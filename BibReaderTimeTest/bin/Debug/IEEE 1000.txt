abstract={There has been a dramatic expansion in both the amount of available large-scale educational databases and educational mining techniques. Educational data mining has been a fertile subject of research in recent times; further, the use of educational data mining has become popular among both researchers and practitioners. Log files generated by computer-based learning environments like Intelligent Tutoring Systems contain a wealth of information about learner behaviors that characterize academic success. There is growing interest in mining these data sources for knowledge-based discovery to reveal relevant, meaningful, and useful educational information to illuminate our understanding of learners' behaviors and outcomes. All too often however, extracting the pertinent information from the data to leverage the data mining techniques can be a major roadblock; for example, the asynchronous nature of the data logged in computer-based learning environments and data mining tools pose several challenges for mining data. We sought to mitigate this by developing a parser for the BioWorld System. In this paper, we explore the viability of a hand-coded parser by presenting BioWorldParser (a suite of scripts), which was developed to parse and retrieve data from raw log files generated by the BioWorld system, to help leverage educational data mining techniques in the context of an Intelligent Tutoring System for the medical domain.},

abstract={Self-directed learning is a potential methodology recommended in medical education to promote life-long learning. To promote self-directed learning skills and to make students life-long learners, self-directed learning sessions were conducted at Melaka Manipal Medical College (Manipal Campus), Manipal University, India. Students' knowledge in the topics was assessed in three formative assessments conducted during the course. This study was conducted to explore whether there is any change in students' readiness for self-directed learning as they experience the curriculum, and also to find out whether the change is reflected in students' academic performance in topics learnt through self-directed learning. To assess the change in self-directed learning readiness, self-directed learning readiness scale was administered to the students at the commencement and at the end of first year of the MBBS course. Students' scores in all three formative assessments were also collected. There was a statistically significant increase in self-directed learning readiness of students at the end of year compared to the commencement. Students' scores significantly increased in second and third when compared to first formative assessment. A weak positive correlation between the assessment scores was observed. The study demonstrated that students' readiness for self-directed learning was increased as they experienced the curriculum which was reflected in their academic performance.},

abstract={To teach and demonstrate the Power System Stability aspects to the undergraduate students, a laboratory model has been developed. Computer based simulation software's are used to teach different aspects of power system by most of the Institutions. These simulation studies often do not demonstrate the physical sense of power system behavior to students. Moreover, making the students to visualize the effect of instability is a very big challenge faced by the teaching community. This paper describes the experimental set up built in the Electrical Engineering Department of Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore, consisting of an alternator connected to infinite bus through parallel transmission lines. In this experimental setup, the generator is brought to instability by changing the operating conditions. Further, the oscillation is controlled and brought back to stability by controlling the excitation and line reactance. This gives the clear idea about stability and its enhancement to the students.},

abstract={Comprehensive curriculum is essential for overalldevelopment of professionals. Like other countries, in Indiatoo the engineering educators have a task of insistingattainment of graduate attributes to suit the global needs. Teaching engineering courses help us to attain the programoutcomes [1]. However, real challenge lies in efficientattainment of ethical principles and effective functioning ofprofessionals as a member in diverse team by effectivecommunication. Thus proper guiding and assessing practical engineering skills is the need of the hour. We focus on educative growth of ethical and communicative skills attained in the present study wherecapstone project is taken as an example. The project issubdivided into two level first the pre-project and the finalproject. Capstone project is an amalgamation of all the basiclearning and the application component of the curriculum. In order to evaluate the attainment of ethical skill andcommunicative skill, the assessment rubrics need to bedesigned well. This work discusses the manner which canmeasure the attribute attainment quite precisely. After acquiring fundamental knowledge on engineering subjects, the students are made to work on acapstone project. Attainment of the program outcome (PO)is quantified with a class with seventy students. The finalyear under-graduate students are divided into group of fourto the maximum. A topic and a faculty adviser ofcorresponding specialization is assigned to each of thegroups. Rubrics of formative assessment are attentivelychosen to incorporate the attributes of ethics and soft skills. Bimonthly evaluations were graded by the guide anddepartmental faculty other than the guide. The summativeassessment is done along with an external examiner from the neighboring institution. Mode of attainment of courseoutcome (CO) to PO has been discussed in the full paperalong with the state diagram of the evaluation process. Asthe students go ahead with execution of the project throughregular meetings with guide, the communication is assessedby rubrics which emphasize the report writing skilldevelopment. The written communication skill is thensubsequently corroborated by oral presentation. Thepresentation is evaluated again to judge the oralcommunication skill as a part of a team of maximum fourmembers with varied aptitudes. Another important point isin the rubrics we have introduced plagiarism check to ensure the ethical attribute of the graduate. By keeping a threshold value for acceptance limit of plagiarism one can evaluate the skill of written communication and originality of thoughts. The attainment of CO to PO is graded from theformative assessment score in pre-project work and finalproject work. In order to take in-depth evaluation, we havetaken 75% of the total marks as the criteria for assessing aparticular skill of a student. Capstone project is consideredas culmination of all the teaching-learning in the curriculumfor the discipline. After framing the rubics and mapping ofthe particular Course Outcome to Program Outcome, logichas been exercised selectively to map with either strong ormoderate attainment of the latter. The process and it's prosand cons will be discussed in detials in full paper.},

abstract={In India, a large percentage of graduating engineers are not industry ready. The primary reason is that the colleges have outdated syllabi leading to a wide gap between the curriculum and the requirements of industry. Students who take up internships are very few among Tier-2 and Tier-3 colleges. All these problems result in graduates who are unemployable without training in basic skills by the industry. An internship could help the students in overcoming many of these shortcomings as they learn about corporate industries and receive basic training. This paper presents a novel initiative towards this end by the IEEE Student Branch, College of Engineering, Chengannur. It aims at spreading awareness about the advantages of taking up internship opportunities, providing the basic training and helping students get internships. The program was a huge success and helped a large number of students in securing internship offers. This model, if replicated in other colleges could significantly improve the employability of students and help them improve their academic performance and engineering skill sets.},

abstract={Higher education or lack of higher education effects many socioeconomic characteristics such as employment, income and social mobility. Increasing access and removing barriers to higher education is a key factor in allowing people from different socioeconomic backgrounds, to make significant change in their own lives.The psychometric test - the screening and entry test used by higher education institute in Israel (the equivalent of the US SATs) is one of the barriers standing between young people in Israel and higher education.Many factors contribute to the ability of an individual to pass this test, some of have nothing to do with ability or motivation. Factors regarding an individual's socioeconomic background affect the outcome of the test, and therefore the access to higher education.While 72% of all individuals how finished high school, belonging to the highest socioeconomic group in Israel, take the test, only 21% of the lowest socioeconomic group do so. The average gap between individuals from the highest and the lowest socioeconomic background is an unimaginable gap of 200 points (out of a possible score of 800 points). This figure means the difference between higher education and no higher education, and everything that stems from it.An industry of about 80,000,000$ (more than 250,000,000 ILS) a year has grown over the years, around preparation courses for the test, with an average coast of 2,500$ (8,000 ILS) per course, giving an unfair advantage to whomever can afford it - the already privileged groups of society.The Ministry of Social Equality in Israel has launched a free massive open online course designed to help university applicants prepare for the psychometric test. With a foreseen Return on Investment of over 605,000,000 ILS in the next 15 years, the course is designed to remove or at least lower one of the barriers to higher education, and promote equal opportunity.This article will elaborate on the reasons behind the decision to create a free open digital course by the government, designed to help learners prepare for the psychometric test. It will touch on the outcomes of the first course runs, and the ways in which the Ministry of Social Equality plans to reach relevant publics and mitigate the course to those publics with little to no experience with digital learning, language barriers, low digital literacy, and low self-efficacy.},

abstract={With the development of latest technologies and their usage become wide spread in all areas of the world. Moreover, using large amounts of data and also their applications are sophisticated and thus the technologies lead to consume huge amounts of energy, latency, bandwidth and also throughput. In the case of client server communication, the client is completely depending on their server at computation logic; meanwhile, the application logic is only performed at the client. When the age of thin clients becomes popular in developing countries with the profits of security, reliability, less vulnerability, maintainability and sustainability have been moved to the usefulness of their inevitable good behaviors. Interactive applications can be caused some bottlenecks of performance delay over thin client server network. The safest technique to access the smooth performance is the explanation and reintroduction of overclocking method which can be used efficiently for the system under some special considerations which was not warranted by manufacturer's rating. As overclocking is not a new method, many researchers have been used it in a variety of application fields and mixed with other resource demand machine learning methods. This paper figures out that thin clients are used with Remote Desktop Protocols connection and the rendering of interactive applications (only used Benchmark apps) on them successfully accomplished by overclocking method.},

abstract={Various learning models have been proposed till date. Many dimensions have been included in different learning models proposed by different researchers. This paper summarizes a number of dimensions important for consideration in learning models. An improved multistage learning model has been proposed which include a large number of factors proved successful earlier. Factors for successful learning have been included from cognitive science perspectives also. Use of this learning model is surely going to prove better for overall success in the learning process.},

abstract={Scripting language employ high-level constructs to interpret and execute one command at a time. In general scripting languages are easier to learn and faster to code than structured and compiled languages such as C and C++. Scripting languages have many important advantages over traditional programming languages. In future the usage of these languages is likely to increase. In this paper we discuss and report our experience in teaching scripting languages lab at the undergraduate level, 4th semester. Scripting language is an umbrella term used for languages like unix shell, TCL, perl, java, python and LISP. Out of these, we have chosen UNIX shell programming and python for our curriculum. The authors report various pedagogical activities like multiple assignments, peer assessment within a group, self learning through e-resources and course project that were employed during the course. The course projects were specially designed so as to make students explore the vast number of python packages. The authors found that these activities definitely enhance the learning experience and there was a remarkable change in the learning level of the students as compared to previous years as evident in the grades obtained by the students.},

Teaching such subjects in a meaningful way is always a challenging task as the students feel that writing code in assembly and Embedded C is difficult. The programmable controllers and processors are taught to Electrical cluster students which usually include Electronics and Communication Engineering, Telecommunication Engineering, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering and Electrical and Electronics Engineering. The traditional method of teaching these subjects was faculty centric where the teacher teaches the theoretical concepts using blackboard or power point presentation. To enable the students to learn the practical applications, there is a need for a new approach of teaching the subject where in the student's performance is evaluated based on various factors such as communication skills, analytical skills, professional ethics etc. In this direction, the paper focuses on the methods based on Outcome Based Education (OBE), adopted by the author to make the students understand the subject better.},

In this paper, we explore all facets of SWAYAM, from its inception to its day-to-day functioning to how the platform is meeting its goal of increasing access to quality education across India. We linger on SWAYAM's most distinctive feature: its credit system, that allows higher education institutions to integrate MOOCs into their offering. We also present some of the early achievements of the platform: In December 2018, the first SWAYAM examination was conducted, with about 16% of India's public higher education institutions allowing their students to earn academic credit through MOOCs taken on SWAYAM [2, 3]. In the second SWAYAM examination, conducted in May 2019, that number grew to 21% [2, 4].},

The translator in a translation not only constructs sense at the stimulus of the source text, but also makes meaning for the readers in the target language, using the target text as a stimulus. Thus the process of translation is divided into two steps: the construct of sense and the make of meaning.},

abstract={In these days of intuitive and intelligent software systems the audience is not going to put any effort into using the product, application or operating system – they'll expect it to be obvious. The perception of any software is driven entirely by its User Interface (UI). Usable software sells better and unusable software is abandoned. Designing usable UIs is challenging and instilling such designing skills in students is even more challenging. This paper investigates Experiential Learning methodology used to imbibe UI Designing Skills in students through the course "Principles of User Interface Design". The primary objective was to attain Graduate Attributes/Program Outcomes (POs) 1, 2 and 3 as defined in the Outcome Based Education (OBE). The approach comprised of two main activities – Identifying Good UIs and Bad UIs and Designing UI Prototypes. A rubric based assessment was used to test the concepts' realization among students. This novel approach did not claim to have given students deeper knowledge in UI designing. Nevertheless, it did aim for a useful foundation. The approach can be adopted in designing good UIs in mini projects and capstone projects.},

The results obtained for the first study indicates that there exists moderately strong relationship. The second study shows that correlation coefficients of related courses are better while that of some unrelated courses have moderate value. This means that in case of related courses the skills acquired in a prerequisite course can help them to do better in the current course. This exploratory analysis when properly interpreted can help plan and retrospect and re-adjust the mode of assessment or course delivery to enhance student learning.},

abstract={Dedicated servers are deployed by companies to meet the ever growing computing demand. More storage and more security are sought after by companies. The inefficient scaling of hardware, higher deployment time, installation of old operating systems on new hardware are just some of the areas where dedicated servers suffer. Cloud severs can be used in lieu of dedicated servers. This will not only decrease the overall IT budget of companies but will be more flexible. This paper is a survey done on three start-up companies to inquire about the dedicated servers. Amazon Web Services have been used to rent a cloud server which hosts a website. Comparisons are done graphically and some observations drawn by the companies' executives about cloud and dedicated servers are mentioned in the latter stage of the paper.},

abstract={One of the original purposes of MOOCs is to democratize education worldwide in order to advance towards a fairer society and universal human development. However, initial findings suggest that there are a number of challenges that MOOCs face to achieve their maximum potential in developing countries and regions with complex issues of access to high quality education. The majority of research studies on MOOCs focus on one or a small number of courses, or an overview of an entire platform or system, such as edX or FutureLearn. However, these kinds of investigations can mask important regional variation in different parts of the world. In this study we conduct a longitudinal analysis using data from six years of courses from MITx and HarvardX, focusing on the particular Arab world sub-population, and comparing to the rest of the world and also on their human development index. A close investigation of this subpopulation will help us better understand what kinds of course registration and course-taking patterns are influenced by regional cultural factors, and what dimensions of MOOC learning are more universal. In this work we present initial results after conducting exploratory analysis on 452 MOOCs (~4.5M unique learners) from MITx and HarvardX, which show that despite the important cultural and geographical contrasts, the general trends are quite similar. Still, we observe some significant differences, such as lower completion metrics for Arabic countries when performing this comparison within each human development category and also some differences in percentage of enrolments per course category.},

The challenge for us as course facilitator is to utilize the existing potential that information technology offers to prepare our students for this information revolution. In this regard, we have proposed an integrated learning framework by considering two courses, web technologies laboratory (WT) and advance database management systems (ADBMS) of sixth semester in information science department at undergraduate level to make students apply knowledge effectively in building real time applications. The key focus of integrated learning was attainment of focused outcomes b, c, g and k (ABET criteria).We are elated that we attained outcome i as a bonus, although it was not focused. In this paper, we show that integrated learning framework led to attainment of focused outcomes, improved skills in students such as presentation skills, teamwork skills, and problem solving skills. This also led to performance improvement in examination and increased student's confidence level. This makes students to stand out in crowd and acquire an edge in competition.},

abstract={Outcome-Based Education (OBE) is a student-centered learning method that focuses on empirically measuring student performance. OBE has become the standard of practice in the engineering education programme. The measurement of student performance is done using both direct and indirect assessment tools. The value obtained out of these tools are then transformed to a score and checked whether they meet the required attainment level of Course Outcome set for a particular Course. The scores of all the Course Outcomes collectively contribute towards the attainment of Programme Outcome. This process is recursively applied for four years until the student completes the Programme. This paper presents a direct assessment method used in measuring the Programme Outcomes (POs) via appropriate direct assessment tools. A sample assessment presented in this paper shows a process of attainment of graduate attributes stated by NBA which are in line with the Programme Outcomes of Washington Accord.},

Anecdotal observations on individual student trajectories reveal distinct behaviors which may correlate with prior experience level. We build models to correlate these trajectories with student characteristics and behaviors of interest, specifically prior experience level and video engagement.

The science of psychology can answer all these questions. But surprisingly, we are never taught psychology as a mandatory science. The World Health Organization has defined health as "a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity". Today's curriculum gives more stress on physical well-being and, contrastingly, very less stress on mental well-being. The question arises “should psychology not be taught in elementary school curriculum?” Of course it should be!},

Introducing a programming language to students with no background is often felt to be challenging in terms of syntax and control flow of a language. The paper discusses an open source graphical programming tool built on Minibloq platform that allows students to focus more on creative part of programming. The paper proposes a graphical approach to programming where a student need not remember any constructs of a programming language, but relies on the approach to solve a problem. The programming utility is developed for an open source Arduino platform. Currently the tool is developed to control a real robot built around Arduino platform. Thus a platform to learn fundamentals of programming as well as robotics is made available to students. The graphical programming tool with the robotic hardware was found to be easy to learn by high school students during an outreach program conducted by the authors. The framework is also extendable beyond programming and can be further developed to understand robotics.},

abstract={Computer systems play an integral role in all facets of the engineering profession. Systems users are always in need of faster, more powerful, yet cheaper computer systems. This calls for an understanding of the processor-level components of computer systems, their design and operation, and their impact on the overall performance of the systems. To fulfill this requirement the course on Computer System Design and Architecture has been introduced in the 3rd semester. Earlier, there were two courses offered with titles “Computer Organization” in Semester 3 and “Advanced Computer Architecture” in Semester 8. These two courses were not related and there existed a gap of 4 semesters in learning of these two courses. Students were unable to appreciate the architecture related concepts in other courses of lower semesters. As mentioned in IEEE SWEEBOK curriculum recommendations, a wide semantic gap exists between the computer's intended behavior and the workings of the underlying electronic devices that actually do the work within the computer. This gap is bridged through Computer Organization. On the other hand Computer Architecture is the course that specifies the relations and parts of a computer system and it deals with mainly three elements viz. Instruction Set Architecture, Computer Organization and Hardware. Accordingly, a course on Computer System Design and Architecture which combines the study of Computer Organization and Computer Architecture is designed to be offered at semester 3. The next challenge came in the form of delivery of the course. Since a detailed conceptual understanding of computer organization and architecture is required, which was not possible only with classroom delivery, self study activity was introduced which provided ability to the students to compare various processor architectures, their functionality and visibility to information processing. This continuous process helped them acquire knowledge, values, skills and understanding that they will require throughout their lifetime.},

One of the biggest limitations/ challenges in MOOC today is conducting effective assessments in a large-scale environment. The quality of large-scale assessment is under threat from multiple sources including assessment instrument specific and measurement errors. Assessment instrument specific errors are related to the extent to which assessments meet its objectives while measurement errors are incurred during the process of evaluation. A survey of sample of existing assessment instruments used for large scale assessments is conducted to identify assessment instrument specific errors. In this paper, we have proposed the usage of technology to build electronic item banks for avoiding assessment instrument specific and measurement errors, thereby improving the quality of assessments. We have proposed 12 unique item types which are amenable for automatic evaluation. The process of evaluating students response automatically is discussed in detail for each item type. These automated item types provides cost effective ways for achieving validity and reliability for large scale assessments.},

This descriptive paper maps the microcredentials that currently exist, using data gathered from the MOOC platforms (e.g. Coursera, edX, Udacity, FutureLearn, and others). Data include price, length of program, availability of academic credit, and level of effort per week on over 450 unique microcredentials. This paper uses a two-step cluster analysis to group miocrocredentials across type, using factors including price, duration, and weekly effort. Grouping microcredentials across MOOC platforms is a first step to understanding what place these credentials might occupy in the overall landscape of higher education.},

abstract={The Indian higher education system in the post-independent times continued the colonial practice and so got isolated itself in the world higher education ranking system and not having indigenous ranking system meant we are practically working in the closed compartments. Except for a few research and management institutions, by and large the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) did not appear in the global rankings, this non- appearance is a reflection of a policy neglect on higher education system in the country, leading to only a few institutions finding their places in the world rankings conducted by different bodies. The policy response to address this problem was that India having National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) to rank HEIs. The two year old NIRF has to be made robust enough for it to become relevance in improving the quality of education system. To this end research paper systematically engages in content and discourse analysis of NIRFs methodology, to identify its gaps and make a policy recommendation for developing it into a robust framework.},

abstract={Outcome based education (OBE) has been adapted in major education institutions particularly in engineering education. This has been used extensively since the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) has made it mandatory for program accreditation. The OBE focusses on outcomes of the program rather than curriculum framed for the courses. Outcomes may refer to the knowledge or Skill gained, competency and employability of the graduates of the program. In order to achieve this outcome, the syllabus has to be carefully and meticulously planned with scope for continuous improvement. In the Department of Electronics and Communication, BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore, We have adopted the OBE system. This paper aims to provide the evaluation process in our department to measure the outcomes. For each course, the course outcomes (COs) are methodically articulated keeping the focus on Program outcomes (POs) that are defined by the NBA.},

abstract={It is well established that learners have different learning preferences. There are multiple ways of characterising learners based on their learning preferences available in the literature. Even though there are efforts to design pedagogic practices considering the learning preferences of learners, it still demands further investigation. Further, what factors influence learning preferences of learners is also an interesting dimension of research. This paper discusses about our observations over changing learning preferences of learners over a period of time and investigating the influence of factors like gender, urban / rural divide and medium of instruction on learning style preferences of learners. This study is desirable as it will help design content as well pedagogy respecting the learning preferences. Learning style preferences of students of undergraduate engineering degree programs are used for the purpose of this study. Though there are different learning style assessment methods / tools available in the literature, because of availability of software tool and the familiarity of authors with the tool, Questionnaire from Index of Learning styles (ILS) by Richard M. Felder and Silverman is used in the study. It is evident from the results that learners' preferences are changing from verbal to visual, reflective to active, sequential to global and sensory to intitutive. The results of the study are presented in the paper and discussed.},

The focus of the work is to suggest a method, where in, the student shall apply the tool to understand concepts of few courses of the on-going semester, or courses of previous semesters. This is achieved through an initial attempt to understand the usage of the tool, apply it to comprehend concepts in suitable courses, and finally use the tool to apply, formulate, design, implement and demonstrate a self-designed task, also known as the ‘Open-ended’ experiment. The proposed method of introducing the modern tool can be included in any semester, and when implemented in most semesters, leads to an overall development of the graduate with necessary attributes, as the proposed method includes an attempt to relate various courses in the program. The work concludes with details of results presented in the III semester.},

abstract={Graph theory has been demonstrated by many researchers to be useful during the conceptual phase of mechanism design. In this regard it has been put to use by many works for systematically synthesizing varieties of epicyclic gear trains (EGTs) of one degree of freedom. This paper makes use of the solutions derived using graph theory and introduces a procedure for identifying the constituent links corresponding to the chosen EGT graph concept so that it can be realized into a 3-D CAD model. It is seen that certain EGT graphs do not lead to meaningful 3-D representation. Conditions for a graph to result in a meaningful EGT structure are also derived in the process.},

abstract={Emerging load demand cannot be fulfilled by the output of one generator. Therefore two or more generators should be synchronized in order to share the load. The synchronizing variables of voltage magnitudes, frequency of the voltages, phase angle difference between the voltages and the phase sequence of the voltages should be considered. Synchronizers are widely employed in the industry. University students learn the theories of synchronization. Most of the laboratories in universities do not have practical modules or laboratory equipment to demonstrate the synchronization process. Traditional synchronization systems are not suitable for the visualization of generator synchronization. “A Practical Module for Generator Synchronization System” is designed to overcome the problem of understanding synchronization process. This system is useful for the students in understanding the synchronization process along with the real time simulation of the synchronization. The system will demonstrate the synchronization process of two generator outputs either manually or automatically. It will also synchronize two generators. The system consists of voltmeters to give the voltage of generator output, frequency meters to give the frequencies of voltages, bulb system to indicate phase sequence, a synchroscope and a phase meter to indicate the pulse width variation of two voltage outputs. The system is prepared for the laboratory equipment and tested under the laboratory conditions. This paper presents how the separate sections of A Practical Module for Generator Synchronization System were developed and its results.},

However, there is a strong feeling in the industry circles that students graduating from engineering colleges are not industry ready and many of them are not employable. Academia has also felt a strong need in terms of producing the necessary quality talent. It has been quite some time since industry and academia started working together to enhance the employability of engineering graduates and make them industry ready. Various models have been initiated by big industry captains to make this collaboration workable. But the big question is how effective these models are in terms of their applicability and usefulness to all the stakeholders in industry and academia. Through this paper, we discuss some of the offerings under the industry academia collaboration model. An analysis of various challenges being encountered during the evaluation of effectiveness of such models is also discussed. A few potential cost effective ways to address the underlying challenges are put forth towards the end of the paper.},

In order to attain the program outcome the curriculum for the program is designed in a manner that the students get trained in all the 12 Program outcomes. The courses are taught to the students by various teaching methodologies like class room teaching, laboratory experiments, seminar and projects. Each course is designed with specific CO's and each CO is mapped to the PO. The attainment of CO's is quantified by assessing students. Their performance is tabulated and analysed using MS Excel software. The quantification methodology involves detailed question paper articulation wherein each question is mapped to a CO and its corresponding PO. Thus considering continuous internal evaluation data one can measure the attainment of CO and the PO for a batch of students. The level of attainment also can be easily varied based on the level of the course and efficiency of the student.},

abstract={The technological rebellion has made current generations to depend more on the digital world in their day to day life. The effectiveness of the digital world has changed the learner's perceptive towards the education system. The impulsivegrowth of technology has increased the popularity of Information and Communication Technology which has created a research scope in Computer network domain thus Computer network course in the curriculum of Computer Science and Engineering plays an important role. It is always a challenge to teach Computer Networks course to students as the course requires a practical exposure more than the chalk and talk. It is very hard for students to envision the concepts of computer networks, protocols formats and understanding packets flow during teaching in classroom. To overcome above said challenge, pedagogical practice such as active learning through simulation tool is identified in delivery of the course. This paper discusses the effective use of a Packet Tracer (PT) simulation tool in the teaching of computer network concepts. A structured learning approach is introduced by using packet tracer tool in teaching network concepts and series of exercises are designed and developed to give the visualization of each layer functionality. These practical exercises helped in active learning to use the packet tracer to simulate campus network. This pedagogy practice encouraged the students' to build the clarity on the physical devices like router, access points, switch and their configurations. The troubleshooting skills were practiced by introducing the errors deliberately and how to resolve is learnt through the tool. Computer network simulation activity include the concepts of NAT, Subnetting, V-LAN setting, services of TCP/UDP, packet format details, application layer protocol like DNS, DHCP, E-Mail, FTP and HTTP. Activity is evaluated through demos, presentation and quizzes. Rubrics based assessment is followed to ensure uniformity and transparencyin the evaluation. The average marks obtained in quiz by students before using PT tool is 65% and after using tool is 85%, it shows significant improvement of 20% in learning the fundamental concepts of computer network course.},

These learning aids involve industry field visits to identify the process parameters of interest for monitoring and control in different application domains, formulate measurement techniques, identify primary sensors, transducers and their deployment, there by facilitating an opportunity for the students to not only connect the theoretical concepts to the real world application but also to develop an exploratory learning attitude, need analysis, communication skills thus helping them to evolve as a pro-active engineering professional. The details of the said approach are carried out at fourth semester level as an experimental basis; the metrics used for assessing the learning outcomes are presented.},

abstract={Recent technologies provide wide opportunities for learning at remote places and enables people collaboration anywhere. In this paper, we present the future advancement in the teaching learning process in India. As mobile phones and tablets are getting more keenly intellective and more widely used than in the precedent decades, they have become a familiar tool in our present environment. Utilizing them as a cognition tool calls for accommodations that are compatible with the concept of communication tools. Various studies suggest that ‘Digital education’ is comparatively more effective than traditional learning. The proposed system uses an inter network for teacher — student interaction and sharing of resources and messages. It allows knowledge-building and learning process to be run in collaborative learning environment. In this system, a student can create, collect and share inculcate data immediately anywhere, anytime. This enables them to play active role in knowledge building process. Hence, we have proposed a combination of m-learning and e-learning based application along with the concept of BYOD (bring your own device) which is advantageous to both the faculties and students of educational institutions for smart learning.},

abstract={In this study, we introduce a model that captures and visualizes the dynamical process of individual intention forming and the translation of this intention into actual behavior when learning in MOOCs. To validate the model and further our understanding of learning in MOOCs, we constructed a short survey based on this theoretically grounded intention-behavior dynamics model. This survey was sent to MOOC learners who at the time of their respective MOOCs indicated that we could contact them for further research purposes. The combination of open and closed questions referred to the most recent MOOC they took and was answered by 84 learners. The results revealed that most learners start a MOOC with a specific intention in mind, but that nearly one third of these learners reformulates this initial intention, once or more often, at some point due to barriers they encounter which hinder or prevent them from reaching their individual intentions. These barriers are mainly non-MOOC related, which may be valuable input for future research as well as guide the development of interventions for supporting learners to reach their personal learning intentions.},

pages={205-209},
abstract={Information systems are growing in both size and complexity. Object orientation has emerged as a dominant paradigm in designing and constructing such large and complex information systems, which is being taught to undergraduate students of Computer Science and Engineering. The use of java technology to develop applications is found preferred one [1]. There exists a knowledge gap between industry expectations and students knowledge. Hence deep learning of java programming is essential attribute to reduce the gap [1]. This paper presents classification of lab assignments as demonstration, Exercises, structured Enquiry type and open ended types with an approach of using conceptual model as intermediate step before writing java code for a given problem statement. This classification of assignments/problem statements move the responsibility from a professor to student where the latter involvement is observed high in achieving the objectives set for each type in classification of assignments, hence helps to meet industry expectations. The conceptual model, drawing a class diagram using standard notations (diagrammatic representations) improves the students understanding of object oriented concepts [7], for a given lab assignment which in-turn eases the student effort in translating the class diagram into program code by following the syntax. The students will be graded during assessment as Grade-S, Grade-A, Grade-B, Grade-C, Grade-D, Grade-E, Grade-F and where Grade-S is highest and Grade-F is lowest. The results of assessment are analyzed for year 2013 and 2014 batches and it is observed that, there is increase in grade A in year 2014 compared to year 2013. The observed change is due to the above said approach. The result analysis of year 2013 and 2012 shows that, the grade F is increased little in results of year 2013, it is due to the current approach where the lab assignments are classified and students are expected to apply the concepts studied effectively and few students unable to follow the approach.},

abstract={Every organization whether it be an enterprise or academic institute, should maintain a proper documentation of attendance of staff or students for effective functioning of their organization. Generally there are two methods of taking attendance in a classroom- calling out students name one by one or taking students signature on paper. However each of those strategies are time consuming, inefficient and moreover proxy can be easily given by students if strength of class is large since it is not possible to verify each student in person. A good amount of the time is wasted in taking attendance and even then many times attendance don't seem to be marked properly. Proxy of students in classroom is a perpetual problem that has to be addressed. Therefore an attendance management system is required which not only authenticates the student but also detect proxies. In this paper we combine privacy preservation and collusion resistance to propose an attendance system which uses an android application to mark student's attendance in the classroom and detect proxies given by students. It exploits the Bluetooth technology to ensure student is present in class itself rather than in the canteen or in the library. Based on the attendance given by students, a trust factor is assigned to each student to determine how trustworthy a student is.},

abstract={Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) offer web-based learning to a global audience. While we have so many institutions offering online courses, not many of them focus on laboratory courseware that would inculcate hands-on learning. Engineering is all about hands-on learning of concepts and needs an effective online laboratory courseware to complement the theoretical courses offered by MOOC. Unlike many Test and Measurement solution providers, who focus mostly on experiments based on their instruments and unidirectional flow of lab courseware, Tektronix launched an online community of lab courseware for basic teaching labs in electronics engineering. Educators across the globe can contribute to the content data base, and access the lab courseware created by other fellow educators. Template and sample lab courseware ensure that follow-on submission of courseware are rich in pedagogic elements and convers a wider spectrum of courses in electronics engineering. This paper is an attempt to present a case study of how this open-source platform is leveraged by educators to share lab courseware and enable fellow educators / students hone hands-on skills in electronics engineering.},

pages={31-33},
abstract={Since 2013, we have used all of the content from our Introduction to Biology Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) with students taking an equivalent on-campus, for-credit course in a mostly ungraded, blended manner. It appeared early on that students on campus watched the videos in high numbers, and more students answered practice problems from within video sequences than the (ungraded) problem sets or practice exams. As a follow-up, we asked, if the position of an ungraded problem impacts students' behavior to try practice problems. We hypothesized that placement of the ungraded problems in the course structure has a significant effect on the likelihood of a student attempting the problems. We predicted that ungraded problems placed immediately after a video segment within a sequence of videos would have a higher number of unique submissions compared to the same problem placed outside of the video sequence. To test our hypothesis, we performed A/B tests on the course content position of ungraded problems during both the fall 2015 and fall 2016 semesters. We positioned the ungraded problems in an appropriate video sequence or under the relevant problem set or exam available for practice in the course website. We found that more students attempted problems when the problems appeared in-between video segments for 34 out of 38 cases. Both sets of experiments (20 problems for 2015 and 18 problems for 2016) support our hypothesis that more students submitted answers to ungraded problems in the video sequence versus when we positioned the same problem in the course structure outside of the video sequence. These results indicate that the online course structure alone can influence student study behavior, a result potentially applicable to the design of blended learning experiences and MOOCs.},

abstract={Many students face cognitive overload and conceptual and navigational disorientation in massive open online courses. We used the learning logs of videos, the difficulty of exercises, the discrimination of exercises, and the student's ability, combined with deep learning, to determine the student's familiarity and mastery of video content. We then determined a knowledge node score, which we integrated with a knowledge map. The map could be personalized to recommend videos and exercises according to the knowledge nodes that had a low score. Therefore, students could learn where they needed to improve and adjust their learning accordingly. Moreover, teachers and teaching assistants could observe students' knowledge maps to understand their performance and help them accordingly.},

abstract={Pedagogy is the core of learning process. It goes without mentioning curriculum design and development play a significant role in creating a learning experience from the student entered fashion. Properly defined assessments with a well driven curriculum really throw a challenge to delivery methods. Thus, pedagogy is important in imparting the knowledge coupled with the requisite skill levels as specified by Dr. Benjamin Bloom. This paper is a case study of one such attempt to introduce new pedagogy by introducing the self-study component into the course delivery method. This has enabled the course instructor to create curiosity among the students in the class by way of challenging them through some minor projects and self-chosen activities to demonstrate their learning through application of the concepts learnt in the classroom and laboratory exercises. This unique change made students to think critically. The outcomes of the study are very much encouraging in two counts, one increase in the cognitive level (test marks improved) and the other is the improvement in skills through demonstrating the concepts by the students who were engaged and inquisitive.},

The popularity of the National Institutional Ranking Framework has led to the competition as more and more institutions are applying for India Rankings. The number of the institutions applying for India Rankings has increased from 1400 in India rankings 2016 to 3000 in India rankings 2017 and to 4000 in India Rankings 2018. We have carried out the study of India Rankings 2016, 2017 and 2018. The study has focused on the parameters, which are the Influencing Factors in deciding the top hundred positions in India Rankings. Based on the result of our study, we have proposed the Ideal and the Minimum Attainment Scores in each ranking parameter to achieve success in India Rankings. The findings will be useful for Institutions who are going to apply in future for India Rankings 2019.},

abstract={It is likely that only a small proportion of educators are willing, interested, and incentivized to complete an entire MOOC, but we believe that many more can benefit from our educational resources if we empower our participants to take our materials and put them to work. We launched the MITx MOOC Envisioning the Graduate of the Future under a Creative Commons (CC) license because we think that making the content explicitly open (with the requirement of attribution) would make it easier for the target audience (teachers, administrators, and others in the education sphere) to get value from the content. The decision to use a CC license, specifically CC BY 4.0, affected course development in several ways. The course team had to learn more about the intricacies of the various CC licenses. The work of finding, tracking, logging, and labeling resources (both third-party and created by the course team) involved a great deal of collaborative, detail-oriented work. Certain resources, like commercially produced music tracks, were no longer a good fit due to conflicts regarding terms of use. From the first run of the course, we now recognize the importance of collecting data regarding how much learners know about CC licenses and also about how they are sharing, using, and adapting our content. We now believe that releasing a course under a CC license does not guarantee that learners will notice and begin sharing and adapting our content. We hope to innovate in terms of data collection to make it easier for learners to report how they are experimenting with repurposing course content.},

abstract={More we know about our learners the better are we in a position to mentor them. This is more so in engineering education as this is a professional course focusing on skills also. Prior knowledge of the learner about engineering profession and motivation level of the learner are two important factors among several others that influence learner's perception of engineering as a profession. There are several approaches used by Engineering Education practitioners to know the prior knowledge of the learner about the engineering profession. This paper discusses about one such technique - Draw an Engineer at Work Test (DAEWT) technique used by the authors to understand the prior knowledge of the learner regarding Engineering profession. Freshman Engineering students are asked to draw the sketch of an Engineer at work. Required data regarding the background of the learner is also collected. These pictures drawn by are studied with respect to their family background and their previous education setting. To know the motivation of the students to opt for engineering program, students were asked to list jobs related to specific engineering disciplines as job after graduation is considered most important motivation. This awareness in the learner is analyzed with respect to prior education setting of parents to evaluate its impact on their motivation. This paper discusses the details of the methods employed and the analysis of the results.},

abstract={In this paper, we will be discussing about active learning techniques which will enhance students' abilities and makes them to overcome the fear of studies and lack of interest. In the present day, most of the students are discontinuing their studies due to many reasons like lack of interest, lack of proper prioritization of their interest, lack of good grade and many more. There might be many reasons for students for not getting engaged into academics but the main reason which makes them uninterested is lack of proper learning or teaching activity. So, active learning is just like a root of the tree which will make students to prioritize their interests in their learning age and make them to put their efforts to reach their goal. This paper also gives a clear idea about how to structure their mind sets and follow the path which helps them to reach their goal and also helps them to prioritize their interests and helps them to adopt according to current market needs.},

abstract={Knowledge, skill and attitude are three necessary ingredients for the success of fresh graduates both in terms of learning and employability. It is important to identify suitable teaching methodology to impart transferable skills to the participants. Outcome based curricula and experiential learning pedagogies create positive influence among participants towards learning. In this paper, Java web development course is considered describing course level outcomes connected with company's entry level program level outcomes. Case studies are used as assessment instruments towards measuring the abilities of the participants aligned with expected skills from entry level developers specific to Java Technology stream. Two approaches are discussed where the first approach uses normal class room delivery and the second approach just-in-time and scenario based approach. In the former one the software engineering and java concepts are covered as factual knowledge components where as in the second approach, an attempt is made to integrate process knowledge components from software engineering together with Java technology concepts using business scenario as a vehicle. The performance of the participants with respect to their case study deliverables is compared with two approaches. These results highlight importance of an integrated approach towards curriculum design and adopting appropriate teaching, assessment instruments towards imparting technical skills.},

abstract={Considering the Massive increase in the usage of Mobile phones and handheld devices such as Tablets, iPads, there is an exponential growth in usage of Mobile apps. Mobile applications are widely used for entertainment, education, for social networks and for increasing productivity. We propose use of mobile applications to teach and to create social awareness for sensitive topics. In developing countries, topics like HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, breast cancer, autism etc. are not taken seriously due to social awkwardness, cultural taboos, education system, social barriers and gender inequality. This paper we proposes a solution to this problem. As these applications can be used personally, there will not be any hesitation compared to discussion with a real person. Interactive application that is created will be explanatory enough for users to get appropriate and correct knowledge with its validation hence, reducing misconceptions. Development of such applications will lead to better awareness and better health for individuals. As a proof of concept, Android application is developed for awareness of HIV/AIDS. After use of mobile app it brings 53.2 percent increase in average marks of knowledge test about HIV/AIDS.},

Each program outcome is achieved through course outcome. The curriculum comprising of various courses is framed under the general guidance of the leading professional body. As course outcome is mapped to program outcome it was found to vary from strong to weak. The delivery methods for various courses attain the course outcomes. Hence, the program outcome is achieved by various teaching-learning methodologies. Out of which, chalk and talk is found as the most effective mode of instruction in undergraduate curriculum despite the availability of many alternate instructional strategies.

abstract={Since 2014 one focus of our research is looking into the effects of integrating Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in traditional education. We have developed in the past different methods of integration: as a full course recognition, partial course recognition, or project/activity based recognition of a MOOCs course completion, into a traditional higher education face-to-face course. The experience on integrating MOOCs in courses at Master level is presented and discussed in this paper. The analyse is based on questionnaires, reports and live discussions with students, during the whole academic semester. Studying online, open education and MOOCs still represent terms students are not familiar with, in Romania in particular. Still, we consider that the Open Life Long Learning Student need to acquire a new set of skills in an independent and self-determined manner as to identify, access, learn, analyse, apply and practice new knowledge using different media, information channels, and communication tools to enhance their skills and develop their careers. The authors proposed an asynchronous online course work to be integrated with the traditional in-class instruction. We looked into the students' interaction with MOOCs, the use of different tools, the educational value of learning online and the MOOCs impact. The conclusions present both strengths and deficiencies of integrating MOOCs based on this blended learning study case.},

The learning outcomes on a long run are reflected in Program Educational Objectives (PEOs), by the graduates of a program, spread in different knowledge spheres. This paper represents a case study implementation for PEO evaluation. An approach for evaluating PEO as an indirect means is being proposed in this case study. The method emphasizes on evaluation and attainment of PEOs. This is accomplished through alumni and employer surveys. These surveys are carried out more systematically by an online process to collect feedback from various stakeholders once in a year. The model proposed here is for obtaining the response for survey questionnaire at the institutional level through alumni association in coordination with placement cell, Industry Institution Interaction cell (IIIC). Further the survey includes inputs from professional bodies as well. Based on the quantitative and qualitative information obtained from the survey analysis and other groups, the PEO attainment is assessed with respect to different attributes. The attainment can be useful for continuous improvement in program.},

abstract={Over the last few decades, technology is increasingly becoming an important aspect of delivering education in formal and informal contexts. While it is true in broader sense, the technology integration has not been widespread and penetrating in developing countries. Moreover the use of traditional technology media such as audio systems and computers have been there for some time, the new media technology integration has been minuscule. The other dimension of technology use in education is the technology acceptance behaviour of users i.e. students and teachers. While it is easier to enumerate the benefits of technology use, it is more difficult to answer as to why users use or reject any technology. This paper utilises Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology to understand the students' acceptance of a Learning Management System in an engineering and Science institute of higher education.},

abstract={Capstone project (CP) is an important part of every engineering and computer science discipline at undergraduate level. The main purpose of these capstone projects is to encourage students to apply the knowledge acquired during their studies in previous semesters, in particular a capacity to personally manage and conduct a complex, open-ended project to show how proficient they are in solving real world or the research based problems. The Outcome Based Education (OBE) is an education system that emphasis on outcomes measurement rather than inputs of curriculum covered. Outcomes may include a range of knowledge, skills and attitudes. In order to obtain the desired outcomes, teaching components and activities should be well organized, planned and continuously improved. We adopted OBE in our curriculum and for the course on project work we have written course learning objectives (CLO), i.e. at the end of the course the student should be able satisfy these objectives and they are mapped with the program outcomes (PO). This paper presents a novel method for the outcome-based assessment of engineering capstone project carried by Final Year Students. The assessment is done based on the rubrics written for each phase of the process. The outcome of the each phase is assessed by evaluation team and the guide using the assessment matrix which is based on assessment rubrics. Assessment matrix covers all the attributes/parameters for the assessment of each phase. Mapping of CLO-PO is done based on these attributes. Percentage of attainment of each objective and outcome are calculated.},

In modeling and simulation lab for the second year undergraduate students, the open ended experiment is designed to expose the students to Internet of things (IOT) applications. Python language is one of the freeware and can be used to implement IOT applications using Raspberry Pi. In most of the industries python programming language is widely used for various test automation. Initially the python language is introduced to implement numerical computation algorithms, so that the students are familiar with the basic libraries. Then the open ended experiment is carried out using Raspberry Pi for IOT applications. In this experiment the students are sensing and retrieving data from the cloud. With this approach the students are exposed to python programming and IOT concepts which is most widely used in industry. It also helps the students to carry out higher semester projects in IOT based applications in a better way.},

abstract={Education apart from the basic needs of food, clothing and shelter, is another key factor to empower an individual. It acts as an enabler to elevate a person socially and from within. Education system has been evolving since human existence and various approaches are being used to teach. Focusing on professional courses, the quality of education is questioned and stands as a concern along with the unemployment issues. In India, there is a huge potential for technology growth. However, as per the National employability report, only 3.84% of engineers qualify for a startup technology role. Further, 2016 employability rate has been 17.91%, 3.67% and 40.57% for IT Services, IT Products and Business Process Outsourcing respectively. Apart from this, there are many forums in which the quality of education is being questioned, since education is linked with the job or business opportunity. One of the essentials in the professional courses is the curriculum design. It is very important to start with the curriculum that can enhance the knowledge of students and also make a prospective career. With these in mind, the improvement options have to be deeply thought and charted out. In this regard, a survey has been taken up with engineering professionals to get their feedback on how they view the education system. This paper focuses on the feedback from working engineering professionals, compares the existing and other curriculum options and provides a proposal for a value based curriculum design.},

Recent emerging trends show a move towards online degrees, essentially postgraduate, which involves the big MOOC providers and universities positioning themselves to capture a growing market of lifelong learners through a broader portfolio of diversified credentials. The core business of curricular education verified by a degree, however, is only just being touched by the MOOC revolution, with very few - though significant - experiences.

Reviews of such models are elucidated in detail of this context. An ideal education system should be modelled to unleash a student's potential & natural caliber. This can be achieved by a gradual transformation towards intuitive learning. Talent and knowledge gained by a graduate is never directly proportional to reputation of university from which the degree has been obtained. In today's world, the reputation of a college depends on the marks of its students and not necessarily on the quality of knowledge imparted by it. Competition is on a major upward growth and there is a dire need for the graduates to stand out and make their mark. Review about the system architecture and of the existing model of education reveals that we focus more on the performance of the students than the effectiveness of their performance. Necessity for technical knowledge about the specialization subject along with the domains which would be required in industry has been explained along with the various innovative models of educations.},

abstract={Outcome-based education (OBE) has become a necessity to make our engineering graduates employable and globally acceptable. OBE is an educational theory that bases each part of an educational system around goals (outcomes). It is expected that after graduation, each student should have achieved the basic purpose of education i.e. necessary skills to work in his/her area of specialization/interest. The assessment is crucial factor in the OBE, as the success of OBE lies in the continuous assessment of the goals and implementing the changes based on the feedback of assessment. This paper discusses the Course Outcomes and its importance in the assessment of Program Outcomes and Program Education Objectives. The authors have presented a case study of Course Outcome assessment and attainment method implemented in their own institute. The course outcome assessment method along with direct assessment and indirect assessment tools, with the detail mathematical calculations is explained with the example values. The results of Course Outcome attainment are used by the staff members for the attainment of POs, PEOs and for improving the overall teaching learning process.},

As a result of the ever-growing social media, it has turned into an essential scheme for viral marketing and influencing the masses. Hence, it becomes imperative to discern how information spreads on such networks and how much. The methodology suggested in the Restrained-Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (RnSIR) Model enables us to calibrate the spread of knowledge and material on networks. This paper proposes an interface which uses the calculations given by the RnSIR model. Essentially, this interface prompts users to give a network interaction data set as the input and outputs the information dispersion on inputted network. It uses the same algorithms to do this as the RnSIR model.},

abstract={Preserving the secrecy of confidential information transmitted over a network has always been of utmost importance. Increasing use of data communication over networks also increases the need of security. Steganography is a technique that screens the existence of information by masking it behind some other seemingly innocuous media. But if the presence of information behind media is revealed by any method, the main purpose of steganography is violated. This paper proposes and analyzes a technique for steganography named Compress-Encrypt-Stego that pre-processes the text before hiding it behind a cover image. In pre-processing, the text is first compressed and then modified using a key. Processed text is then concealed behind cover image using transform domain based steganography. DCT is used to transform the cover image to frequency domain. The technique is implemented for various cover images and for different values of plain text and keys using MATLAB. The proposed technique is analyzed by varying the number of bits used to hide the data. This paper also discusses the security analysis of the proposed technique.},

abstract={During the last decades, our society is witnessing an authentic revolution that, in a dizzying manner has deeply influenced, modified, and transformed the way of life of human beings. This constant and unstoppable revolution is transmuting all areas of our life: social, cultural, personal, labor, economic, training, etc. This new society is characterized by a high generation of knowledge and the constant and fluid processing of information. In this macro-context, the MOOC phenomenon emerged. MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) courses are based on the principles of massive, free access to all materials and resources offered online. This new didactic path can be constituted in an innovative techno-social tendency, especially oriented in the panorama of Higher Education to stimulate university improvement, open opportunities at the same time for education and training or, simply, derive towards a new business model for the universities. In addition to being an entry point for the popularization of science and knowledge, the future possibilities are enormous and are being studied in all their various dimensions. Many initiatives as a result have been developed to implement this new form of education. MOOC Courses and the Future of Higher Education presents the latest research theories and current examples of MOOC courses practices in Higher Education. The chapters represent an extensive assortment of interpretations and practices examples of MOOC courses, across areas as varied as teaching methodologies, instructional innovations, educational technology, etc. This work is structured in three sections, the first one covers the university institution in the knowledge society, the second analyzes the MOOC training proposals, and the third discusses the future role of MOOCs. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • The Virtualization of Teaching in Higher Education • Training and Professional Development at the e-University • Taxonomy of MOOCs • MOOC: Strengths and Weaknesses • MOOCs and the Scientific Community: Challenges and Innovation • MOOC Platforms • Directory of MOOC Resources • MOOC: Reflections of the Future},

abstract={MOOCs are arriving to the business sector. Especially within Human Resource Development and customer training. While some companies offer their own MOOCs, a few companies use external MOOCs to complement their HR offers. However, the awareness and perception level among HR managers in general is still lower as expected. On the other hand, many learners are taking MOOCs to upgrade their skills for the current job or to open up new career pathways. This indicates that employees and business learners are already making use of MOOCs on a global level, which leads us to the assumption that there is a significant bottom-up movement from professional lifelong learners in MOOCs. As there are no specific studies available for the European context, this article sets out to answer the research question if this bottom-up movement in the uptake of MOOCs by employees can be confirmed for Europe.},

abstract={The rapid and impressive development of MOOCs in less than half a decade has brought about contrasting arguments about the social dimension of MOOcs. This paper investigates how the socio-economic background of learners affects their own experience in the on-line course and their chances of course completion. We test whether learners from low SES have lower chances of completing the on-line course and whether participation in online discussion forums mediates the role of SES. Analyzing data from two MOOcs provided by Stanford University, we find that in both cases the hypothesis of a negative association between low SES background and course completion is supported. Moreover, we find that forum participation further reinforces the advantage of well-educated learners enrolled in one case, while does not have any significant effect for the other course. We conclude with some design implications for creators of on-line courses.},

abstract={During the last decades, our society is witnessing an authentic revolution that, in a dizzying manner has deeply influenced, modified, and transformed the way of life of human beings. This constant and unstoppable revolution is transmuting all areas of our life: social, cultural, personal, labor, economic, training, etc. This new society is characterized by a high generation of knowledge and the constant and fluid processing of information. In this macro-context, the MOOC phenomenon emerged. MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) courses are based on the principles of massive, free access to all materials and resources offered online. This new didactic path can be constituted in an innovative techno-social tendency, especially oriented in the panorama of Higher Education to stimulate university improvement, open opportunities at the same time for education and training or, simply, derive towards a new business model for the universities. In addition to being an entry point for the popularization of science and knowledge, the future possibilities are enormous and are being studied in all their various dimensions. Many initiatives as a result have been developed to implement this new form of education. MOOC Courses and the Future of Higher Education presents the latest research theories and current examples of MOOC courses practices in Higher Education. The chapters represent an extensive assortment of interpretations and practices examples of MOOC courses, across areas as varied as teaching methodologies, instructional innovations, educational technology, etc. This work is structured in three sections, the first one covers the university institution in the knowledge society, the second analyzes the MOOC training proposals, and the third discusses the future role of MOOCs. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • The Virtualization of Teaching in Higher Education • Training and Professional Development at the e-University • Taxonomy of MOOCs • MOOC: Strengths and Weaknesses • MOOCs and the Scientific Community: Challenges and Innovation • MOOC Platforms • Directory of MOOC Resources • MOOC: Reflections of the Future},

abstract={An enhanced Synthetic Aperture Radar algorithm (SAR) has been proposed for sea ice detection based upon region based segmentation using raster scan method. The MODIS data of RADARSAT1 and RADARSAT2 has been used as input data. This method consists of four stages. In first stage, input the radar image for processing. In second stage, apply Gabor filter to remove the noise from image. In third stage, apply region segmentation technique and scan the image using raster scan method. In last stage, calculate the parameters of ice like velocity, thickness and concentration to display the results. This paper is focused on noise removing process to enhance the accuracy of results using Synthetic Aperture Radar algorithm.

Industries are very much open to such an experiment and very cautious on deliverables by practice. They are encouraging project based learning and working very close to academia through their dedicated university programs. Internet being most widely embraced by the young generation, an attempt has been made to use the facilities like googles mail, blog, drives and youtube to the maximum for maintaining continues involvement and hence demonstrated the use of same in the education system. Being an autonomous institute is very good opportunity to adopt innovative teaching learning methods. Advanced Microcontroller and its application course being an elective at 3rd year of engineering education, offered for students having the knowledge of microcontrollers and programing language was more suitable for the project based learning. One such experiment is made in BMS College of Engineering(BMSCE), Bangalore. Methodology adopted and the results of the same have been covered in this paper.},

abstract={Quality is directly related with satisfaction of the learner and one can satisfy only if the learning environment provides full technical and infrastructure support and interactive user interface. Quality Analytics is the discovery and the systematic computational analysis of data statistics to find meaningful patterns especially valuable in areas rich with recorded information. Quality Analytics of learning environment evaluates the application based on various relevant quality parameters such as Business Qualities, Generic Qualities, System Qualities and Learner Response Qualities. These parameters should be focused upon to design analytical pattern to monitor the learner behavior. If any of the web-based application fails to deliver these then it clearly reflects the compromise in the quality of the product. ISO/IEC 19796-1 international standard focuses on quality management and assurance in e-Learning and it is also mandatory to scrutinize and assess the results generated by various quality factors in dynamic web based learning environment. This paper proposes analytics based method to generate and monitor values of some critical quality factors. Effective assessment of these factors is helpful in tuning the overall performance of dynamic web based learning environment and the analytics confirm the learner behavior towards the learning application.},

abstract={Computation is becoming an integral part of education, especially at college-level. Two MOOC courses provide an introduction to computation and are offered by MIT on EdX: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python has run 16 times and 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science has run 11 times. These courses frame the world around computation, and show learners that they can think about problems they see in everyday life in the context of computation. Our paper shows an analysis of repeat learners (learners who enroll in the same course multiple times) and their behaviors over the many runs of these courses. Around 20% of learners in any given run of a course are repeat learners. Of these, the majority are two-time repeat learners (learners who took the same course exactly twice). We show that learners tend to perform better when they retake a course, and especially when they retake the course sooner rather than later. We also look at a subgroup of learners we call repeat cross-referencers (learner who accessed at least two previous runs of the course during the run time of a later run of the course). We found that repeat cross-referencers complete the course at a suspiciously high rate, and we speculate it is because they are looking back at answers from a previous course run. Lastly, we look at how learners perform in an introductory class and an advanced class. We found that many learners who take both courses are more likely to complete both courses and have more active days in the courses than those learners who only do one of the two classes.},

abstract={Creation of a technology enabled social learning ecosystem was started as an experiment in 2014 at the BMS College of Engineering, in partnership with WIKSATE. This platform available to the students for use anytime, anywhere, in any smart device, enabled them to connect and share with their peers 24×7, and learn as they interact even while on the move. The implementation of the platform was expanded gradually over the years to support all the departments and courses. This platform is now available to the entire college. With over 3500 students actively engaged in supplementing their formal education with social learning, the BMS College of Engineering is now the largest social learning ecosystem in India. The WIKSATE platform provides the students at the BMS College of Engineering, a powerful interaction engine to connect and share their learnings with their co-learners in a knowledge network. Further, this platform provides real-time data to faculty which give insight into student preferences and engagement and help plan continuous improvements in the course delivery and outcome. It also helps promoting a culture of openness and moderated learning providing a vital bridge to close the gap between educators and students. The results from the social learning analytics show that students have a natural motivation and inquisitiveness to get involved in interactions when empowered by a mobile centric ubiquitous access to knowledge networks. The results also show a steady growth of student interactions at all levels after their induction into the ecosystem.},

Our sample consisted of 131 students (male=66, female=65) studying in the 8th grade. All students had the same level of exposure to science courses at the school. A five-point Likert scale questionnaire was administered to understand students' interest, ease of use and attitude towards OLabs-based ABL. The investigation revealed that a sizable majority of the students, were excited about using OLabs based ABL methodology, in their current curriculum as well as in the future. The gender based analysis showed that female candidates were more interested in using ABL methodology. Our findings contribute to the design of a new pedagogy model for incorporating low-cost science activities with virtual labs to reach students in schools that do not have access to science labs.},

abstract={This work presents an overview of strategies to foster the participation of non-English speaking learners and instructors in the global online learning space. Taking into account the amount of people in the world whose first language is different from English, there is an increased need to extend the reach of online education initiatives into these traditionally excluded populations. Nowadays, the current state of multilingual support includes the usage of translated captions, subtitles and language specific platforms, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. A case studio based on data gathered from student feedback of Spanish-speaking learners of a popular MOOC is presented, where it is acknowledged the additional effort needed to study using material and holding forum interactions and discussions in English as a second language. Finally, further strategies are presented so instructors and online education providers could extend their reach and engagement.},

abstract={Evaluation is a process of assessing and measuring the educational system through many techniques like oral or viva-voce exam, subjective exam and objective exam etc. After conducting a survey on 200 peoples, we found, objective exam is preferred to evaluate the students frequently due to the easy and less time consuming in the evaluation of objective answer-sheet in compare to the subjective answer-sheet. This paper is a discussion on a solution to evaluate the objective answer-sheet automatically by computer. It is used to automate the import data which emanate from objective answer sheets into a computer. Its main advantage is the ability to work with every single scanner of the market, needing no extra drivers whatsoever and no special color printing of the forms. Optical character recognition technique is used here to recognize the response of the students. Thirty objective sheets were filled by 30 peoples to test the proposed system.},

abstract={Currently the traffic control system in place in our country is non-flexible and non-adaptive to the ever growing number of vehicles on the road. It does not take into account the changing density of traffic during the different hours of the day. Consequently the roads get congested frequently and intersections get blocked. Time and fuel, two highly important resources get wasted in this inefficient working of the present-day system. In this article, we propose a dynamic system that overcomes all these drawbacks. Our system uses cameras installed at the red lights and intersections to monitor the traffic dynamically. It then processes this information using image processing, computes the volume of the real time traffic, sets the timer of the signal accordingly. Simultaneously, it monitors if there is any scope of congestion at the intersection and adjusts the timer to prevent it. The entire system works autonomously and has a quick turnaround time, saving critical resources at every junction. The system also has the potential to adopt machine learning techniques in order to recognize the different emerging patterns of the future traffic and reach an optimal solution.},

The simple type of thin client only has minimum power consumption, less movable parts and fewer memories for storage. So, using the computers with the least power consumption becomes significant trend. The measurement of electricity usage of normal thin client is logically guessed and theoretically measured. The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is used to configure the thin client with the dependent server. The watts usage of the thin client and server are presented and it is very helpful for computer universities of developing countries. The least power consumption of the processors leads to the cleanest environment for future users. Moreover, the configuration cost for thin client is absolutely zero illustrated in the paper as it is based on obsolete PCs.

This constant and unstoppable revolution is transmuting all areas of our life: social, cultural, personal, labor, economic, training, etc. This new society is characterized by a high generation of knowledge and the constant and fluid processing of information. In this macro-context, the MOOC phenomenon emerged. MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) courses are based on the principles of massive, free access to all materials and resources offered online. This new didactic path can be constituted in an innovative techno-social tendency, especially oriented in the panorama of Higher Education to stimulate university improvement, open opportunities at the same time for education and training or, simply, derive towards a new business model for the universities. In addition to being an entry point for the popularization of science and knowledge, the future possibilities are enormous and are being studied in all their various dimensions. Many initiatives as a result have been developed to implement this new form of education. MOOC Courses and the Future of Higher Education presents the latest research theories and current examples of MOOC courses practices in Higher Education. The chapters represent an extensive assortment of interpretations and practices examples of MOOC courses, across areas as varied as teaching methodologies, instructional innovations, educational technology, etc. This work is structured in three sections, the first one covers the university institution in the knowledge society, the second analyzes the MOOC training proposals, and the third discusses the future role of MOOCs. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • The Virtualization of Teaching in Higher Education • Training and Professional Development at the e-University • Taxonomy of MOOCs • MOOC: Strengths and Weaknesses • MOOCs and the Scientific Community: Challenges and Innovation • MOOC Platforms • Directory of MOOC Resources • MOOC: Reflections of the Future},

There is also the Education Act of an India, 1987. Some of the guidelines are that: An institution of Higher Education may be sponsored or owned by the Government of the State or Local Government or by a Company incorporated in India or by an individual or association of individuals who are citizens of India, and who satisfy the criteria set out in the Schedule to the law for establishment of institutions. In 2003, the UGC of India passed a law permitting establishment of private universities. The private university act mandates the state body as well as UGC to regulate and undertake quality control of the content and curricula of academic programs. It is noticed that some newly approved private universities not following UGC Regulation 2009 which leads to failure of doctoral candidates who takes admission referring to allowed universities list from UGC website.},

abstract={Gesture recognition turns up to be important field in the recent years. Communication through gestures has been used since early ages not only by physically challenged persons hut nowadays for many other applications. Interacting with physical world using expressive body movements is much easier and effective than just speaking As most predominantly hand is used to perform gestures. Hand Gesture Recognition have been widely accepted for numerous applications such as human computer interactions, robotics, sign language recognition, etc Hand Gesture recognition techniques are basically divided into vision based and sensor based techniques. This paper focuses on vision based hand gesture recognition system by proposing a scheme using a database-driven hand gesture recognition based upon skin color model approach and thresholding approach along with an effective template matching using PCA. Initially, hand region is segmented by applying skin color model in YCbCr color space. In the next stage otsuthresholding is applied to separate foreground and background. Finally, template based matching technique is developed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for recognition. The system is tested with 4 gestures with 5 different poses per gesture from 4 subjects making 20 images per gesture and shows 91.25% average accuracy and 0.098251 seconds average recognition time and finally confusion matrix is drawn.},

abstract={The biggest driver for today's education is to match assessment to learning. School District (SD) leaders support efforts to hold schools accountable and are working to promote greater congruence between what's tested and what kids need to learn, if they are to thrive in the future. In order to promote important life skills like creativity, problem solving, and communications, one needs to have a hands-on life experience which is not only enjoyable but rewarding as well. Education is undoubtedly a tool for empowerment and IEEE K-12 STEM Literacy program in USA is fully committed to its implementation. Through various resources, like Tryengineering.org, Trynano.org and trycomputing.org, IEEE is trying to reach out to various school districts to tool teachers with hands-on lesson plans. IEEE is taking on the role of engaging the School Districts for further development of STEM programs more articulated & supportive of the specific/tailored needs. Working with and building a track record and demonstrating to potential partner School districts to have a history of returning dividends for their investments, increases the likelihood of IEEE being seen as serious and worthy partner.},

Learner interactions with Intelligent Tutoring Systems yield fine-grained data that are useful in generating meaningful information and illuminating understanding about learner behaviors and outcomes. We examine and analyze the log files generated by BioWorld, an Intelligent Tutoring System for the medical domain. More specifically, to further our understanding of the nature of reasoning employed by learners while solving virtual patient cases in BioWorld, one important step is to examine the initial list of selected diagnostic hypotheses before any other learner action is taken in diagnosing a case. By exploring the link between initial selected hypotheses and final submitted hypothesis, a better understanding of the learners' reasoning might be achieved.},

pages={100-104},
abstract={The paper emphasizes the need for teaching and learning mathematically intensive theory subjects using very powerful software tools. Under Electrical Engineering discipline, there are subjects like Signals & systems, Control Systems, Digital Signal/Image Processing etc. where teachers need to spend a considerable amount of time in classroom, teaching the mathematical concepts, ending up with very low level of learning by students. Learners find it very complex and unrelated as mere lecturing doesn't help them in effective interpretation of the information conveyed. There are many such software tools available nowadays having a powerful graphical data flow programming environment with a rich set of library functions and tools sets in simulation and real time mode. Such tools can simplify the teaching and learning of subjects with intense mathematical background in lesser time for the students from non-electronics stream. Here we present the efforts of teachers in learning and teaching, Signal acquisition, processing and analysis techniques for sixth semester students of Automation and Robotics in a much effective manner, using LabVIEW tool. The processed data can be presented from the tool using measurement graphs, indicators, animations, tabulated data, automated calculations, physical interpretation, visualization effects etc., thus enabling the learner with better understanding of concepts. Here we present the results of extensive use of tool to teach and learn different signal processing and analysis techniques used for biomedical signals along with the experience shared by teachers and students undergoing the activity. Course projects implemented by students after undergoing the proposed activity helped teachers to know the accelerated process of learning of the basic concepts of signal processing by students.},

In our workflow the autoevaluated programming exercises are created as if we were doing some test-driven development where the problem is our functionality and the unit tests are actually the verifications done to generate hints and evaluate the students. Once the problem is designed the unit tests create a code, based on the answer and the Anonymous userID, code that is obfuscated using an encryption technique. That code is used as the answer of a standard Open edX problem, creating a completely automated personalized environment and avoiding the use of Open Response Assessment tools that depend on the correction of other students.},

abstract={The concept of Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) brings the opportunity to adjust both the study content, and the context, based on the teaching needs. Therefore, in this paper, we present our best practices on enabling remote networking laboratories via Blackboard platform, including the Blackboard Collaborate Ultra extension, in order to efficiently react to the challenges of imminent campus closure imposed by COVID-19 breakout. We present an extensive survey as a feedback from students, which allowed us to measure and to quantify students’ experience and satisfaction with the remote teaching setup that successfully served 45 enrolled students. As the results bring the positive attitude towards practices presented in this paper, such teaching practices will foster some of the critical skills nowadays, such as collaboration, self-driven learning, and problem solving, and they can also serve as a successful example on how to efficiently cope with the limited access to traditional classroom resources within various courses.},

abstract={Assessing the quality of MOOCs is an important issue for learners since learners are paying fees for accessing the content (e.g. graded assignments), certificates of completion and for course credit. One of the unique advantages of online courses is that all the content can be assessed and analyzed even before the courses are released using various learning analytical and natural language processing tools. However, to date there are few studies in the literature published on the analysis of MOOC content. Furthermore, MOOC providers expect the course developers to periodically revise their MOOCs. Various types of analysis that can be done on the course text, video transcripts and assessments such as readability, listenability, videolytics, and text analysis. By analyzing the course content before its release, the content can be adjusted to target various learners. Subsequently, the same techniques can be used to analyze the discussion board posts and post-course survey to identify areas in a course that need to be modified in to order to improve the course quality for subsequent release. In this paper natural language processing and MOOC analytics were applied to several MOOCs to identify areas for revision to enhance their quality.},

abstract={The Covid-19 pandemic is changing our society on diverse dimensions (not only on an economic or social level). Before the 1970s, various businesses and economics could affect and improve technologies, and humans' life. Since we reached the 70ies, and with the beginning of the 3rd wave or the post-industrial era, the new modern technologies such as Information Technology (IT), Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Business (IoB), Internet of Energy (IoE), Internet of Manufacturing (IoM), Internet of Health (IoH), the emerging digitization, and innovative smartness in addition, issues such as know-how, do-how, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and others could influence businesses, the economy, urban infrastructures, societies, social impacts and even human life. Wars, sanctions, sciences, technologies, IT, IoT, and smartness work together and have impacts on each other's, businesses, economy, and human life. Fundamentally, during humans' history inventions and innovations have been created through restrictions and challenges. Wars, sanctions, low sustainability, risks of contagion, recessions, climate pollution, environmental change, biodiversity collapse, urban sprawl, growing urbanizations, lack of infrastructure, gentrification, economic instabilities, and recently health crises are introduced as main restrictions. Wars and welfare integrate with human's life desirably or undesirably and make innovation. Improvement through such innovative digital technologies are so admirable because most of them have changed the world. Sustainability has an important role for societies and urbans to improve their quality of livability and life. The world academic economy has changed from an academic SocioEdu economy to a data and innovative academic SocioEdu, ecosystem and economy, leading to the concept of the "Internet of Business-Education". with many popular IoT applications involved (i.e. wearables, smart city, smart society, smart healthcare, smart welfare, smart SMEs, smart retail, smart supply chain). This pandemic throws a spotlight on the interdependencies among business, nature, society, economy, and education. It may be tempting right now, when it is hard to see beyond the next few weeks, to dismiss the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a distraction. But they have been described as a "crowd-sourced purchase order from the future" precisely because they offer a tremendous business opportunity. Based on SDGs all developed and developing countries in a global partnership have to go with CSR strategies and Hybrid Businesses for improving social cohesion and welfare, health, education, inequality, blue-green environmental sustainability, and economic efficiency. In this article we will discuss how the 5th Wave/Tomorrow Age and i-Sustainability Plus theories could help us for a readiness to forecast, prevent and face to the SocioEdu Consequences of Covid-19.},

abstract={Developmental theories have established that adults are learning oriented only when they are convinced that there is a need to learn to effectively deal with real-life challenges. In such a scenario, it is affirmative that there has to be an ecosystem which is created to encourage learners to discover their own ‘needs to know’ and that learning interventions should be organized around real life application categories and sequenced according to the learners' readiness to learn. If learning could leverage employee know-how and further it, we would be able to customize learning to an individual's need. In the managerial space, we have opportunities where employees across levels and roles in the organization have access to the same content. In a scenario like this, learners ask the question-why should I refer to this source of knowledge? If learning could leverage employee know-how and further it, we would be able to customize learning to an individual's need. Even if we talk about only the managerial space, we have opportunities where employees across levels and roles in the organization have access to the same content. This paper is a case in point of the opportunity to customize and adapt content such that it leverages employee experiences to find meaningful and different value in the education path and process of every learner.},

In an endeavor to make the learning process more engaging through mobile platforms which perhaps attract the students and help them to gain knowledge with interest. Efforts have been done to make the process of online tests and information delivery to the students, yet there is a gap in knowledge transfer between teachers and students. Here we have proposed a platform that utilizes the combination of biometric scanners, speech to text conversion techniques and image processing techniques to make the process of learning effective, interesting, and collaborative. We have added a tool that uses today's modern mobile technology to take attendance and reduce the wastage of valuable time in the class. Also we developed a tool, called Smart notes that have ability to reduce the burden of taking notes on students and worry about the knowledge gap between sections of the same campus. To reach out to every student we have found that the Instant Chatting tool introduced will be helpful to clear all the doubts. This tool can be used to for group discussions and to perform group activities. Hence the platform introduced integrated with three tools provides an excellent quality of education to fulfill every students need in comparison to the existing methods.},

abstract={Many real time applications, they are generated continues flow of data streams have became more popular now a days. Therefore many researches attracted clustering data streams. Most of data stream clustering algorithms based on distance function which find out clusters with spiracle of shape clusters and unable to deal noisy data. Therefore density based clustering algorithms substitute remarkable solution to find out clusters with arbitrary shapes of cluster and also handling noisy data. In which the clustering is performing with the bases of high density area of objects and also segregate low density objects as noise. In this paper we studied a simple existing data stream clustering algorithm DenStream based on DBScan. Based on DenStream a novel data stream clustering approach “DDenStream” is proposed. DDenStream is a modified data stream clustering algorithm of DenStream. It is based on fading window model therefore it applies a density decaying technique when the evolving data streams are captured and improved the quality of clusters by extracts the boundary points when two or more than microclusters are overlapping each other by using DCQ-Means algorithms. This approach also resolved the overlapping problem of microclusters. It find out arbitrary specs and good quality of clusters with noise.},

The review highlights an innovative approach of requesting students of computer science to become active members of existing OS communities as part of their curriculum. The acquisition of a wide range of skills, increasing student motivation, support for contextual learning and student-centered courses as well as the availability of a wealth of data to inform and support decision-making by educators are the main advantages as identified by the SLR. Similarly, high barriers to entry in OS projects, difficulties related to student support, assessments, grouping of students and choice of an adequate OS project are the potential challenges. In this paper, the advantages and challenges of using OS in an existing framework of a course design and delivery have been discussed in detail. In particular, the potential impact of OS in computer science education curriculum has been explored from the perspective of education providers.},

abstract={In the current pandemic emergency, where everything changed in a matter of hours, many fields have confronted the situation with emergency responses, in many cases, with openness and collaborative approach. In the context of education, some view the current emergency as an opportunity for digital transformation and innovation in education. However, the emergency responses to have the desired impact in the long term, need to be strategically thought-through and planned. In this paper, we argue that open practices, sound design and virtual mobility based on administrative support principles can bring opportunities for quality education. Moreover, we reconceptualize and recontextualize the notions of blended, hybrid and flexible learning within this situation. The current paper is a conceptual contribution drawing on a case of a university experience, with a radical transformation focus, contextualized in current covidl9 educational emergency. To conclude, we propose a Hybrid Flexible Learning Framework based on two main pillars: virtual mobility and design that could be a useful conceptual tool for the current situation but also for future consideration, beyond the crisis.},

pages={68-72},
abstract={Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) generally have two modes of course delivery: the instructor-paced mode with multiple fixed deadlines to complete assessments or the self-paced mode with a final deadline when the course closes. Many MOOC platform providers have shifted from delivering courses in instructor-paced mode to self-paced mode, assuming that a longer, flexible schedule allows learners to better engage with and complete courses. Although this question of self-paced versus instructor-paced is not new, the answer is still relevant given that studies comparing the two course delivery modes of MOOCs provided mixed results and the pressure to run all MOOCs as self-paced. In this study, we took a deeper look into learner engagement differences between the two course delivery modes for one quantitative biology course and one computer programming course. Despite the differences in enrollment numbers and content, we found similar trends between both courses involving benefits to instructor-paced over self-paced delivery, especially when evaluating more engaged behaviors like posting to the discussion forum or submitting a problem answer. Interestingly, most completers finished the courses across 80-90% of the available days in an instructor-paced run. For self-paced runs, the median range of time a completer was active was less than one fifth of the time the course was open, but some completers did take advantage of finishing the course in a smaller or maximum window of time. We also found that most completers were active a similar total number of days in self-paced and instructor-paced course runs, despite having more days available in the self-paced runs and that the activity per day per completer was lower in self-paced delivery mode for both courses.},

This paper focuses on integrating classroom and laboratory with hands-on for programming course. This approach is student centric which brings in active learning. However it has been less researched area and adequate literature is not available on 'hands-on science' specifically for programming course. The work presented in this paper also extends from our previous work where debugging, code optimization and testing are emphasized. In the proposed approach each teaching session consisted of hands-on teaching and activities to support it. This requires strategic planning of the course and its delivery as discussed in the paper. Applying this approach, there is increase in the number of students scoring higher grades and overall improvement in the average. The paper also discusses the benefits and challenges of hands-on discovered in this case study that triggers further research.},

abstract={The University of South Africa (UNISA) is the largest committed open distance learning (ODL) institution in South Africa. In line with ODL principles, UNISA has rolled out electronic (e)-learning to all undergraduate modules as from 2013. An important challenge for the university has been the transition from the traditional paper-based mode of instruction to e-learning. This transition requires an e-readiness strategic plan prior to the e-learning rollout. E-learning readiness comprises an intricate, in-depth, continuous process of identifying critical issues that may impede the successful rollout of e-learning within the institution. There are a host of factors that need to be considered prior to embarking on an e-learning initiative which have not been considered prior to the e-learning rollout initiative of 2013. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for an e-learning readiness framework that can be used proactively for new e-learning initiatives and retrospectively to evaluate existing e-learning interventions to identify weaknesses in current e-learning practices. The objective of this paper is to improve interactive technology-enriched teaching with regard to e-learning practices.},

abstract={The status of education has always been the primary factor of a nation that defines its academic capital, human resource and vision of development. Sheathing this education sector with the recent advancements of technology would be one of the most concrete steps towards national development. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have evolved as a new paradigm of digitized open education which could be implemented in a massive domain of India. In a developing country like India where significantly large number of people live in rural areas and cannot afford quality education, MOOCs can definitely be considered as game-changer. The authors have worked over different aspects and strategy for implementing MOOCs over the vast domain of India. In this connection, different issues haunting implementation and their possible way outs have also been discussed briefly. On one hand with a more flexible and massive approach, MOOCs would be able to impart quality education over a huge domain of audience. On the other hand it would nurture the tremendously viable business opportunity in education sector. In this context, India is viewed as a potential leader and game-changing superpower of education in Asia pertaining to Vision 2020.},

abstract={Even today, there are institutions that, due to technical problems, lack of workers with the appropriate skills or because they do not have a sufficient budget, do not have an internet connection in the classroom where technology-related subjects are taught. Through this article we propose a new hybrid teaching method that combines the Open Massive Online Course (MOOC) and face-to-face work of the students. First, we present the problems identified along our experience. Secondly, we define both, the classroom resources and the educational resources we have used. In a next step, we describe in detail the architecture of the system and the communications that compose the proposed learning hybrid system. We have assessed that the proposed solution is valid, but we are planning to deploy pilot tests to indicate the features and limitations which can be addressed when teachers use this proposal. These pilot tests are framed within STEM and robotics education. The content to assess the solution in a future is also included in this paper.},

pages={84-88},
abstract={Graduate programs in engineering have theoretical courses like Software Engineering, Information Systems, Advanced Software Engineering, Software Architecture, Management and Entrepreneurship as part of the curriculum. These courses are challenging from both the students' and the instructors' points of view. From student feedback it has been seen that they view these subjects uninteresting due to a lack of practical component. The instructor's responsibility increases in making such theoretical subjects interesting for the students. These courses impart certain unique skills which the students need to apply in their professional careers. But the Lecture method which is still the most practiced and preferred one does not provide for active student involvement. To combat this problem a variety of teaching modes have been developed from different learning theories. Several of these techniques are in use in Post-graduate courses and corporate training courses where the number of participants is less. The author has tried some of these techniques like story-telling or case study approach, involved assignment and group correction, reverse knowledge transfer, i.e. teaching by students, etc. while teaching Information Systems for two sections of undergraduate students and has found reasonable success. This paper describes the techniques used by the author, the methodology, the implementation and the results thereof. Attempt has been made using quizzes/tests to draw conclusions about the viability and applicability of these innovative techniques in classes where the number of students is more than fifty.},

abstract={Recently, most of the engineering educational institutions are assessing their degree programmes for improving their curriculum design, teaching methodologies, assessment and evaluation process. There are clear guidelines prescribed by the Government accreditation bodies of each country for defining, assessing various graduate Programme Outcomes (POs). There are two ways to assess the POs such as direct and indirect assessment. Direct assessment of the programme outcomes includes various curricular components such as continuous assessment, final examination, assignments and projects etc. In general, indirect assessment of the programme outcomes includes various survey components. We have followed the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) body of India, for defining and assessing our Information Technology (IT) programme outcomes. This paper includes the efficient strategies that we have practiced in our programme for improving the POs of undergraduate IT programme. We have grouped POs into three major categories such as knowledge, skill and attitude. Along with NBA guidelines for assessing the graduate degree programme, we have considered few other assessment components such as co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. In this paper, we have discussed the IT programme outcomes of the past three batches of students and their improvements year-by-year. From the results, it is evident that the strategies improved the entire POs of IT programme at our institution.},

abstract={Today, more than ever, institutions of higher learning are recognizing the importance of integrating the use of information technology (ITs) to improve pedagogy and accountability needed for high quality education relevant for learners' productive contribution to the society and economic development. Despite increasingly widespread adoption and use of IT in education, institutions of higher learning in many developing countries are still in a foundational stage of maturity. Much as e-learning and its applications like Massive online open courses (MOOCs) have been proven to overcome critical education challenges for better teaching and learning developing countries institutions are lagging behind. Some challenges are systemic and some related to the technologies themselves like poor infrastructure and low bandwidth, others are due to lack of scalability to meet the increased cost, training, and rigor required to leverage the technology.

pages={104-111},
abstract={Stable task assignment among processors is a shrewd effort because such approaches require priori information about current processor load and then perform allocation. Initial policy structure includes no information about processor load but as the task groups arrive and get scheduled, this information acts as a prerequisite for next allocation. The task of load stability is tricky when static scheduling strategies are followed in allocation because these strategies require supplementary efforts to balance the load as the approaches designed so far do not follow load stability criteria during task allocation; rather they follow task adjustment to balance the load later on that enriches the overhead of context switching of tasks among processors. Context switching efforts not only includes the efforts for changing process address space, but position in ready queue is also affected. The work projected in this desertion performs load stability with priori information about processor utilization, based on this metric value processor space is partitioned among different categories. Depending on the load status, processors are categorized and an appropriate set out of those is identified that act as buddy for others and handles incoming queue. In other words stress free “buddy set” handles incoming job queue in place of their “stress underneath buddy set” processors so as to eliminate the pains of context switching and tasks adjustments after the tasks allocation.},

abstract={The pervasive presence of mobile devices and growing trends like ubiquitous learning make new demands on Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Users learn increasingly on the go and with multiple devices, instead of being tied to a fixed workstation. However, there is a lack of research how the usage of mobile devices influences the learning behavior and outcome in MOOCs. Thus, this paper presents a first quantitative study to examine this question. To enable a statistical analysis, a proof-of-concept implementation outline is presented, which enhances the Learning Analytics capabilities of the openHPI MOOC platform with contextual data to process various learning behavior metrics. Based on an analysis of four courses, it was found that users who additionally learnt with mobile applications showed a higher engagement with the learning material and completed the course more often. Nevertheless, the reasoning must be addressed with qualitative analyses in future, to better support their learning process and success on mobile and stationary devices.},

abstract={In the perspective of growing demand for research accountability, every university is making it an objective to achieve optimum performance in terms of research and development. Successful completion of research depends on the kind of supervision received by students from their supervisors. As students' satisfaction directly affects the quality of research at the university level, there is an urgent need of an explicit system that evaluates students' satisfaction with their supervisors. This paper aims to examine the experiences and challenges of post graduate research students with their supervisors. For this, data were collected through face-to-face interviews and a questionnaire aimed at recording response from 100 post graduate students of a private university in north India. From the study we identified relevant parameters like supervisor's expertise, active listening, availability and self seeking behavior etc. As these parameters are imprecise and difficult to measure directly, these can be expressed in fuzzy context. A fuzzy based approach is used to propose a system that measures the overall student's satisfaction.},

abstract={The new innovation in technology has enhanced online educating, for instance, virtual laboratories are progressively used to teach engineering laboratory activities. Technologies like virtual and augmented reality have reshaped the virtual learners experience. While a large portion of these endeavors' accentuation the significance of the innovation, few have tried to comprehend the procedures to capture, model and codify the laboratory tutor's knowledge. The absence of robust methods on how to automate laboratory tutor's knowledge to teaching and monitoring practical task on virtual platform has influenced the engineering distance learning outcomes. Subsequently, [1] suggest there is a need to investigate further on the best way to capture the laboratory tutor's knowledge, which is essential for teaching and assessing the practical skill of the engineering distance learners through current virtual and augmented reality technologies. In this study, we propose a Knowledge Based Educational (KBEd) framework that facilitates automating on-campus tutors' knowledge into augmented reality (AR) technology. Our study investigates the benefits of using artificial intelligent (AI) and augmented reality (AR) environment in teaching and assessing engineering practical skills. Further the study determined the usefulness of the proposed system by evaluating through first year engineering students with no prior experience of welding. The study results demonstrate that students who learned through proposed AI tutor in the AR environment effectively picked up the practical skills proportional to those in the genuine lab condition who learned with the real laboratory tutor.},

abstract={We propose a preferential theme matrix for selecting a problem in carrying out the minor project for 6th semester Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) students. The matrix comprises of emerging technologies, research areas and the application domains as the parameters. It included Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Mobility and Web Technology as emerging technologies. The focused research areas were on big data & analytics and image processing. The application domains were focused on social relevance such as environment monitoring, health care, safety and security, agriculture. And an additional open choice (others) was mentioned which gave an opportunity for students to explore other new technologies and research areas. Broadly the phases of conducting minor project are classified as team formation, problem identification/selection and project execution which in turn has several sub phases. In team formation students were given freedom to choose their partners with a team size of 4/5 within the same division. This phase was analyzed with respect to Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) grades of team members, which showed a good distribution of grades within the teams and across the entire teams. In problem identification the teams discussed about theme matrix with the assigned guides and presented the project synopsis to the evaluators. After these phases the project execution which in turn included requirement specifications, design, implementation, testing and deployment. To meet some of the pre-requisites for carrying out the projects, workshops on IoT, Cloud computing and open source design tools were organized. For promoting self learning in students, MOOC on the relevant technologies of their projects was introduced as part of minor project. The Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE) of minor project focused on the processes of software engineering and Semester End Exam (SEE) was focused on product/prototype development, technical skills and external recognition. The entire process of conducting minor project met the expected goals with five prizes in SRISHTI state level project exhibition 2016 and five projects accepted for E-poster presentation in international conference.},

abstract={Self-study is realized as a tool for lifelong learning. In order to improve the professional skills of budding engineer, self-study is a component of teaching learning process which helps teacher to monitors the materialization of student activity. The skills that can largely be developed by self-study are communication, critical thinking and practicing modern tools. Activities assigned to the students are (1) Assigning literature to read and apply in their laboratory experimental understanding, (2) read, comprehend and understand the advances in the corresponding field, (3) to demonstrate the concepts taught in class by an experiment (4) get trained and use modern tools for problem solving. The attainments of specific outcomes defined by NBA are designed in such way that it brings desirable change in the student way of learning. Self-study aids the process by measuring various technical and non-technical learning outcomes of student learning. It provides opportunities for students to learn or refine their knowledge of technical concepts traditionally taught in a classroom as well as concepts that are difficult to teach in a classroom setting. Further, it reveals the combination of both teacher-centered and student-centered teaching methods which involves student's activity, gaining and sharing knowledge among the peers. This paper discusses the design, development, implementation of self-study module in the core course of heat transfer in one of the engineering curriculum of BMSCE. It encompasses in-detail discussion on framing of course outcomes, evaluation of different self-study component with rubrics, mapping of CO to PO, improved program outcomes attainment obtained for two consecutive student batches compared with traditional course. The method utilizes data obtained from student marks in internal tests as a means of continuous internal evaluation. This paper discuss the mode of evaluation of selfstudy component, and reasons for the enhanced attainment of CO, PO and hence PSO. The practice of self-study will pave a framework for encompassing cognitive and psychomotor learning outcomes of engineering curriculum.},

pages={90-97},
abstract={The popularization of online chatrooms facilitates students to discuss, question and answer based on their learning content. The chat text reflects students' learning concerns, learning progress, learning enthusiasm and so on, which has important reference and analysis value. But the previous studies on students' chat text were mainly to explore the participation behavior and interaction patterns, while less attention was paid to the dynamic process of students' learning. Meanwhile, the existing technology lacked effective analysis methods for the highly variable and multi-topic commingled chat text. Therefore, this paper proposes the Multi-topic Analysis by Extraction and Combination (MtAEC) architecture. On one hand, MtAEC locks the questioner and respondent in the chat, tracks and collects their text, and calculates the text similarity to verify whether the lock result is correct. This method confirms the role of the questioner and the respondent in the chat. On the other hand, to solve the problem of topic analysis in the multi-topic commingled chat text, MtAEC points the parent pointer to the interrogative sentence, and traverses down the child pointer to search the answer. In addition, this paper analyzes the topic of the students' chat and visualizes the experimental results in the form of charts based on the group chat text of a real course. Then, we summarize the students' learning concerns, learning progress and learning enthusiasm, which are helpful for teachers to better understand the dynamic changes of the students' learning process.},

But with the rapid development of online education, few people put emphasis on the quality of online education. More people concentrate on the spreading and expansion. There is still much to study and talk about. The paper builds a distributed data warehouse and analyzes the course data from Coursera. It measures the real quality and effects of online education in country distribution, homework completion, grading policy and peer assessments. The paper introduces a new grading policy for peer assessment and talks about the current problems and the future development of MOOCs.},

abstract={In recent years an engineer or technocrat graduated from any country is expected to provide his/her services to any location of the globe for the betterment of mankind. In this respect it has become necessary that an engineering graduate possesses a set of skills which encompass technical knowledge, practical skills and right attitude. Every educational program defines its program educational objectives (PEOs) and program outcomes (POs)/course outcomes (COs) which spell out the capabilities that a graduated and graduating engineer should have respectively. In this regard, an Outcome Based Learning (OBL) has become an accepted philosophy in technical educational institutes. This paper discusses the basics of OBL and presents a case study carried out for one of the courses of ETC program for the attainment of desired POs through spelled out COs. The study clearly indicates that a focused teaching-learning process and an appropriate assessment has led to attainment of expected POs to a level of more than 70%.},

abstract={Mobile applications for MOOCs (Massive Open On-line Courses) offer the possibility to download learning material to enable network independent learning sessions. The management of downloaded content on mobile devices is a manual process for the learner, which has the potential for automation. This includes the deletion of learning material that is likely to be no longer consumed. In this paper, a metric was defined to quantify learners’ references to previous videos based on the order in which the videos were viewed. In an observational study involving three MOOCs in the field of computer science and IT systems engineering, learners referred to previous video content only a single time on average. Outliers made use of earlier content up to 44 times during a course. Referenced videos belonged in most cases to the current or previous course section. The learners referred more often to previous videos during the course period compared to when participating in self-paced mode, while learners who earned a record of achievement referred to previous videos significantly more frequently than those who did not.},

abstract={The pedagogy of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) can be easily developed by using robotics and computational thinking tools. Also, inclusion and integration of diverse groups of students can be promoted using these tools. Today we can find many tools for teaching robotics. This kind of tools allow us to promote innovation and motivation of students. In this way, students will be able to work during the learning process in an innovative and motivating way. Since it is increasingly common to find robots in our daily lives, it is important to integrate robots into education as well. There are already cooking robots, autonomous cars, vacuum cleaner robots in houses and gardens, or prostheses. This paper describes a course focused on a combination of teaching methodologies, educational robotics tools, and a student learning management methodology, all within an inclusive framework to strengthen the presence of women and other under-represented groups in engineering.},

abstract={Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) can be a platform for campus students to publish co-created educational material. Involving students in the creation of a MOOC has the potential to lead to a more learner-centered MOOC while also providing students with the opportunity to gain skills. This exploratory case study evaluates that potential. We analyze the learning gains of the students, the MOOC they created (the product), and our own support during the development process. Analysis shows that the MOOC had a similar quality to our other MOOCs. Videos and assignments were more creative than usual, but were not created with a much more learner-centered focus. The students gained valuable skills while making the MOOC, such as leadership skills and video presenting skills. The support from university staff was seen as very valuable, but could have been expanded to truly elevate the quality of the content. We end this paper with some practical recommendations for other teams wishing to help students create a MOOC.},

abstract={Although the massive and open nature of MOOCs necessitates more technology support for instructors, existing prediction research has been barely capable of offering real-world solutions. One critical case where MOOC instructors could benefit from real-time technological support is the design of collaborative activities, in particular group formation. In this regard, this research work investigated the use of in-situ learning technique to produce useful and actionable information that could assist instructors in group formation while the course continues. Focusing on a particular MOOC context, a predictive model was created to compute the probability that students would participate in group discussions or not. Using these probability scores, actual group behavior was also predicted for three cases: at least 2, 3 or 4 different students would post in group discussions. According to the results, the model was able to accurately predict individual student behavior as well as group behavior before the actual collaborative activity had taken place, suggesting its potential for real-time use. Future research involves the exploration of other approaches for creating actionable predictions and the application of the predictions in practice in an ongoing MOOC.},

abstract={This work illustrates the use of Design of Experiments (DOE) as an experiential learning in Electrical Machines laboratory. DOE is a systematic method to determine the relationship between factors affecting a process and the output of that process. This information is needed to manage process inputs in order to optimize the output. The objective of this work is to provide an exposure to students on experimentation and simulation environment as a part of structured enquiry problem in the course. A common problem statement was given to the class of eighty students. A batch of five students worked as a team in order to accomplish the task. The problem statement focused on developing the second order response surface methodology based model to predict the speed of a motor by conducting DOE with two control factors and three levels each. Sixteen teams were given common problem statement with varied ranges of control factors. Full Factorial Design (FFD) was selected as a suitable design of experimental layout plan. Each team conducted nine trails for two control factors and three levels. To further validate the model, nine additional experiments with random control factors have been carried out to test the accuracy of the model. Students were introduced to open source simulation tool which was used to predict the response. As per the estimate of laboratory schedule for solving structured enquiry problem, the students were assessed in accordance with the rubrics published well in advance. The competencies addressed for activity are problem analysis, ability to design experiments, individual and team work, simulation. The analysis was concentrated on deviation of predicted and actual measured values of motor speed, regression, and variation of output response with respect to two control factors. This activity helped the students to analyze the results for the proposed problem. As per the assessment, the attainment of the competencies - problem analysis, experimental design planning, individual and team work is around 65.6%, 90.5% and 84.2% respectively. However there is scope for improvement in area of coding as the attainment is comparatively low with 72.5%. As per the students' feedback, their learning is enhanced after having undergone this activity in comparison with classroom learning.},

abstract={Understanding the Learner requirements is an important aspect of any learning environment as it helps to recommend the LOs in a more personalized manner. With the growing demand for MOOCs offered by coursera, edx, etc. the learner information plays a vital role in understanding the extent to which the learners can gain out of such courses. The Learning Management Systems (LMS) across the web uses the explicit (rating, performance, etc.) and implicit feedback (LOs used) obtained through interaction with the learners to derive such information. As the requirements of the learners varies with the individual's interest and learning background, a common approach for recommending LOs may not cater the needs of all the learners. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes reinforcement learning based algorithm to analyze the learner information (derived from both implicit and explicit feedback) and generate the knowledge on the learner's requirements and capabilities inside a specific learning context. The reinforcement learning system (RILS) implemented as a part of this work utilizes the knowledge thus generated in order to recommend the appropriate LOs for the learners. The results have highlighted that the knowledge derived from the learning information analysis proved to effective in generating personalized recommendation policies that can cater the context specific requirements of the learners.},

abstract={Life-long learning is necessary for all professions because the technologies, tools and skills required for success over the course of a career expand and change. Professionals in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields face particular challenges as new multi-disciplinary methods, e.g. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, mature to replace those learned in undergraduate or graduate programs. Traditionally, industry, professional societies and university programs have provided professional development. While these provide opportunities to develop deeper understanding in STEM specialties and stay current with new techniques, the constraints on formal classes and workshops preclude the possibility of Just-In-Time Mastery Learning, particularly for new domains.The MIT Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center (LLSC) and MIT Supercloud teams have developed online course offerings specifically designed to provide a way for adult learners to build their own educational path based on their immediate needs, problems and schedules. To satisfy adult learners, the courses are formulated as a series of challenges and strategies. Using this perspective, the courses incorporate targeted theory supported by hands-on practice. The focus of this paper is the design of Mastery, Just-in-Time MOOC courses that address the full space of hands-on learning requirements, from digital to analog. The discussion centers on the design of project-based exercises for professional technical education courses. The case studies highlight examples from courses that incorporate practice ranging from the construction of a small radar used for real world data collection and processing to the development of high performance computing applications.},

In this view Electronic instrumentation program is divided into two verticals embedded system and process automation to provide domain specific Knowledge to students and courses are designed to fit into these domains to satisfy current industrial needs. To provide more hands on experience curriculum and related activities are planned at three different levels. At first level(Second year) along with laboratory course, activities are planned and defined as course projects which augments theoretical concepts and also aids in interconnecting various courses for integrated approach, these activities strengthen the conceptual knowledge of students. Next level (Third year) theme based Mini and Minor projects are planned, themes are decided based on Subject learnt in previous semester and recent technological developments. These activities provide a platform to realize applications belonging to a specific theme. In the final level capstone projects are grouped into Industry projects, product development and research oriented projects. Students are allowed to extend their academic experience into areas of personal interest, working with new ideas, issues, organizations, and individuals. These activities helped students to develop their communication, interpersonal, project management, and design skills. It also provides students with an understanding of the economic, financial, legal, and regulatory aspects of the design, development, and commercialization of the technology with these activities carried out throughout the year we are able to achieve better quality in paper publications, winning awards in prestigious project competitions conducted by industries and academia along with improvement in placements, Semester End Examination and addressing professional and technical outcomes of ABET.},

abstract={In the last decade MOOCs have been leading the modernization of Higher Education, going from traditional teaching and learning models to hybrid teaching and learning models. The opportunities afforded by MOOCs (and the technologies arising from MOOCs) are endless, and the new hybrid models defined so far are still in an early stage. A new taxonomy that allows organizing these hybrid models in three broad categories (sequential composition, parallel composition and interleaved composition) is proposed here with the aim to help teachers and institutions to identify models that suit their needs and apply them in their practices.},

Ontology development is a concept which is integrated with the imparting e-Learning in higher education system. Ontology is used to represent and manage knowledge. The ontological engineering methodology is widely used in many domains of computer and information science, cooperative information systems, intelligent information integration, information retrieval and extraction, knowledge representation, and database management systems. In this paper we have attempted to create a web-based tool named Knowledge Analyzer for teaching disabled students. The main focus is to impart knowledge of Java in the form of videos and tutorials. There is evaluation module that provides the quiz to learner to evaluate and self-analyze their knowledge. The instructor also provides the guidance on the basis of the marks. The Knowledge Analyzer is evaluated on the basis of feedback provided by the students. There feedback is provided by the student after using the Knowledge Analyzer. The most of the students liked the module and some students suggested some enhancements in the Knowledge Analyzer.},

Inspite of all the excitement and hype surrounding the MOOC phenomenon a number of doubts also exist parallel to the hype. In India the MOOC concept is still to catch on in the education scene with a number of academicians expressing their doubts over whether it will be a success or not. Research in MOOC technology is also becoming a potentially new area in education technology. However, many people are still unaware of the various aspects of MOOC technology. This paper is an eye opener that will describe the history, the various terminologies and technologies associated with the MOOC technology. We will outline the essential steps that have to be taken care of before developing a MOOC. The challenges and issues that are currently facing this new technology are discussed.

abstract={Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) have become popular in various regions of the world through the years. Since 2008, this phenomenon has received plenty of attention from higher education and universities across countries began to produce these courses. The countries of Europe and the United States are the world’s leading producers of MOOCs and research studies reporting on this topic. This previous research has focused on (1) analysing data from global providers such as edX, Coursera or FutureLearn; (2) describing learners’ characteristics from a small sample of courses in these regions; and (3) offering overviews of courses and platforms. However, research in other regions such as Latin America or Africa are very scarce. As a consequence, little is known about local initiatives in Latin America region, and about the needs and characteristics of its learners. Moreover, this has generated an unequal and biased perspective of what we know today about MOOC learners. To close this inequality gap, this work, presents a cross-platform exploratory study in Latin America, using data from more than three million learners and seven different MOOC providers to generate a joint comparable analysis about students’ characteristics in this region with others regions in the world. Preliminary results report on the differences and similarities of trends based on level of education, age, gender of students, their level of activity and performance of learners in Latin America through the different providers of MOOCs. These results help us understand the MOOC ecosystem in Latin America and report results to the entire community, while at the same time calling for more large-scale studies between researchers and institutions.},

abstract={Designing is a prominent process in engineering field to build prototype model of a system. In Software Engineering approach, Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) models a system as a group of interacting objects. The aim of OOAD is to understand the problem utterly and all its inferences for its potential users. It is one of the designing courses that the students are learning in their curriculum and it is also used throughout the software development life cycle. Since OOAD has involved completely theoretical concepts and the tutor may face difficulty while teaching. The main issues to understand the course by students are recognizing the objects, analyzing and mapping objects to the real world. These issues provoked the authors to use pioneer approaches to teach effectively this course. This paper discusses few pedagogical tools to teach the course efficiently for Post Graduate (PG) students. Since OOAD course is also associated with laboratory, different open-ended problem statements are given for each student to carry out the experiments using Rational Rose tool. The group of two students is assigned to learn an open source tool to design a given application. Some of the open source tools learnt by the students are Pace Star, E-draw, UMLet, AgroUML, Astah etc. Each student have selected different concepts of OOAD to do the survey of conference/journal papers and presented the work as a part of Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE). These novel methods improved analysis, design, implementation and learning ability of OOAD concepts. These activities enhanced their confidence level, communication and presentation skills.},

abstract={MOOCs and SPOCs have been key elements in accelerating the digital transformation of many higher education institutions. The fact that higher education institutions can offer online courses, such as MOOCs or SPOCs, facilitates also the virtual mobility of students so that a student enrolled in one university can take online courses from other universities at the same time. This has the great advantage that students can take exams at their home university with local invigilation, in this way solving one of the problems with MOOCs. Nevertheless, there are numerous aspects that should be considered when implementing virtual mobility. These aspects affect several stakeholders besides students: teaching staff, teaching support services, IT services, etc. This paper discusses nine of these key aspects: 1) course selection, 2) teaching, 3) lab, 4) office hours, 5) communication, 6) documentation, 7) exam, 8) transcripts, and 9) campus life. For each of these nine aspects the who (students' identity), the what (contents) and the how (tools) are analyzed, based on the experience gained in the European Virtual exchange (EVE) project, and proposing new improvements for these aspects.},

abstract={Online Education has proven that can provide rich learning environments and stimulating experiences. However, the inherent physical distance in online education/learning complicates the learning process in some educational areas. This is the case of subjects related to technical aspects, in which the knowledge cannot be attained only through ideal models. Traditionally, this disadvantage has been alleviated by the substitution of real labs by simulators, however, simulators still obey a model. More recently, remote labs-real instruments and equipment, performing experiments in real environments, which are controllable remotely-grant the opportunity to provide real labs in online courses. The availability-both, temporal (24/7) and geographical-is the key feature in which remote laboratories lie. This aspect makes remote lab an ideal tool for online education/learning and, in most cases, the unique way to provide a contact with real devices in a 100% online educational model. This is nevertheless false in courses in which scalability is a requirement. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) inherit the advantages and disadvantages of online education/learning approach. However, scalability is a must in MOOCs and remote labs, as any other real system, have physical limitations. In this paper, we will show the integration of a remote lab in a MOOC and how the physical limitations of a real environment have been overcome.},

year={2016},
volume={},

pages={47-53},
abstract={Higher-order thinking, known as higher order thinking skills (HOTS), is a conception of education reorganization based on learning taxonomy. Skills involving analysis, evaluation and synthesis are considered to be of higher order, requiring diverse learning and teaching methods than the customary learning of facts and concepts. HOTS involves the learning of complex judgmental skills such as critical thinking and problem solving. They are activated when individuals encounter unfamiliar problems, uncertainties, questions, or dilemmas. Successful application of the skills results in justifications, decisions, performances, and products that are valid within the context of existing knowledge that encourages continued growth in other intellectual skills. The major difficulty in attaining HOTS among engineering students is that we still pursue the traditional approach of teacher-centered classroom where the teacher is an active transmitter and the students are passive recipients. To achieve HOTS among engineering students we establish an Active Learning Environment (ALE) with the effective usage of Information and communication technologies (ICT). Active learning is embodied in a learning environment where the teachers and students are actively engaged with the content through discussions, problem-solving, critical thinking, or a multitude of activities that encourage interaction among learners, instructors and the material. Supporting to active learning, the ICT usage lends itself to more student-centered learning. This paper demonstrates the strategies to achieve HOTS through various ALE strategies like Role Play, Jigsaw, Brainstorming, debate, Mind map etc for Concept Understanding and Group assignments, combined mini projects, Discussion on Topics, Quiz, and Puzzles for Concept Applying. We have applied various learning strategies and assessed the student outcomes. HOTS is achieved by developing applications or products, with improved inter personal skills and lifelong learning skills. The evidence for the effectiveness of ALE among engineering students is showed by great improvement in their academic result, placement record and research interests},

abstract={Present day's amount of computational requirements has shifted the processing of data from the regular way to parallel way of computation. Pipelined processors, array processors can be employed to construct design of parallel hardware. These systems constructed can be further extended with the help of scalar and super scalar systems. We provide an efficient way of implementing Winograd's variant of Strassen's matrix multiplication on parallel systems by making use of RMI(Remote Method Invocation ) which provides us distributed object oriented programming, multithreading programming. Multithreading approach helps a lot in concurrent, dynamic and asynchronous programming. In this paper clusters have been made from very basic hardware systems which are connected on local area network using switch and a master system connected to this switch uses three NIC. The facility of Winograd's variant of Strassen's method to run in divide and conquer approach is the basic fact around which whole analysis has been performed. Actual partitioning (AP) of a given matrix into sub matrix according to cluster size and at each system logical partitioning (LP) of each sub matrix into size 2×2 has been performed which on a whole covers the aspect of SIMD based model. The parallel computing metrics like speed up, efficiency, excessive parallel overhead proves RMI as a better approach for distributed computing as RMI provides look and feel like a user is working on local machine as not much overheads are being there in order to convert a non-distributed application to the distributed one.},

This paper attempts to understand some of the essential characteristics that distinguish a MOOC user from a non-user in India. A proprietary survey for understanding MOOC consumers has been used to draw insights on demographics of potential MOOC users including age, occupation, gender, educational backgrounds as well as some salient aspects of their personality, learning styles and life goals. Three logistic regression models have been tested. The first model investigates the impact of background demographic variables and internet skills of respondents on the choice to enroll in at least one MOOC course. The second model includes key personality traits that are hypothesized to influence the user adoption of MOOCs and the full modeladdsvariables pertaining to learning styles, learning environment and life goals. Those with better internet skills and an existing preference for learning through videos were seen to be significantly more likely to adopt MOOCs. Personality traits aligned with an openness to try new things were seen to influence the adoption decision but the learning styles and learning environment did not differentiate users from non-users. The results also indicate a significant influence of gender and age.},

abstract={The University of South Africa (UNISA) is a mega Open Distance Learning (ODL) institution in Africa. UNISA is considering advocating totally online tuition in the near future. Currently, e-learning (electronic learning), is used for online teaching. However, e-learning is only one component of a conglomerate of components that must be taken cognisance of when designing an integrated online teaching framework for the university. The predominant role of e-learning cannot be undermined as technology has a very high educational contribution, but often technology is viewed as the sole driver to ensure that learning outcomes are achieved. Adopting an integrated robust best practices framework to online teaching practices based on multiple components for academics is far more important than being merely technically competent. However, teaching is not the sole mandate of UNISA. The university has a tripartite mission to deliver quality tuition, research and community engagement. This paper proposes an integrated best practices framework to online teaching, research and community engagement within an ODL sphere. Integration is achieved by consolidating the current teaching, research and community engagement practices of the institution within a consolidated best practices framework. The objective of this paper is to present a standard best practices framework which can be applied across the university, which academics can use in the development of new online practices regarding tuition, research and community engagement or as a means of evaluating or enhancing existing practices.},

Targeting students at an earlier stage in the STEM education pipeline is crucial for securing measurable gains from a business perspective by ensuring that there will be adequately educated workers to fill high-tech jobs and insure healthy global competition for the future. To that end, this paper reviews the existing state of affairs and proposes the establishment of an internationally collaborative STEM program for high school students in underserved communities both here in the U.S. and in countries in sub-Saharan Africa.},

abstract={Algorithms are the foundation of Computer Science and Engineering, which instruct the computer to do the required task efficiently. Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course is aimed to develop problem solving skills, choose appropriate design strategy and analyze given algorithm for its performance in the student community. In this paper authors propose active learning methodologies like Manifold Problem Assignment, Inspection of Algorithms, Technique Based Learning, Identification and Designing Method and Realization of Algorithm to meet above mentioned objectives. Since the course is taught along with tutorial, different set of problems are given across the batches to develop and analyze an algorithm by choosing appropriate design technique. Tests are conducted on each design strategy, which helped the students to apply them to the design process. At the end of the semester students are given set of problems, where they are expected to choose suitable design strategy like divide and conquer, decrease and conquer and transform and conquer to write and analyze the algorithm. Through this pedagogical activity, the Program Outcomes 3a and 3c of ABET 3a-3k are achieved. 70% of learners strongly agreed that their problem solving ability is enhanced and 30% of learners agreed that there is an improvement in algorithm design ability.},

abstract={Team-based learning (TBL) is a form of student-centered active learning which will help to develop various professional skills, problem solving, interpersonal team skills, and self-directed independent learning. The success of TBL approach depends on its design comprising Team formation, Project identification and distribution, monitoring the progress, maintaining open discussion in every phase and peer evaluation. This paper presents the case study TBL design done for minor project course. First step, the team formation plays a very important role in projects. Therefore the teams are formed based on the complementary skills of the student and ensuring that each team has an expert member in every identified skill. The next step is project distribution, while distributing the project the team strength is calculated and accordingly the problem statements are assigned. Also to increase the motivation and learning in the team, open discussions are held where each team can review and critic other teams work in every phase. The last part in the TBL is assessment and evaluation, which is incomplete without including peer evaluation. Although the Team work is evaluated by the instructor, the individual evaluation is done by both instructor as well as peer students within the team. This TBL design has improved the team's performance and each individual is able to work better in a team. Here students could successfully build and lunch mobile app as a product. The paper gives results of various TBL components. It concludes with challenges faced in this case study for further research.},

Based on the student scores in matriculation, senior secondary, subjects in various semesters of technical education and demographics, PPS predicts the placement of a student in upcoming recruitment session. The steps involved in designing and building logistic regression model is stated using the past academic and in-house placement data of Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC), Ludhiana. Machine learning parameterized approach is used to support research and analyze the students performance in previous sessions. The results are generated from an open source GNU Octave programming tool. The developed model has been applied to predict the placement of students at training and placement office (TPO). The testing of PPS brings about promising 83.33% accuracy. The learned parameters of the model gave insights into the placement process. Hence, the TPO decided to adopt this system to help them in informed decision making. This application endows the targeted group of students to boost their placement probability.},

A punctual case is the vast number of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) that have appeared, forcing to rise a question: What is the better methodology to deploy a MOOC? The answer is given from different standpoints, but blended teaching seems to be a promissory solution. We propose here a methodological scheme based on blended teaching to implement a MOOC deployed with an OpenEdx platform. An initial application of the methodology over the undergraduate course “physics of electricity and magnetism” serves to illustrate the benefits of a partial transition from traditional teaching model in the short time. Our experience shows that this methodology is promissory and should be further developed.},

abstract={Entrepreneurship is a key driver of economic growth of a country. However, concerns on uncertainty associated with entrepreneurship drive parents to motivate children during their formative days to aspire for permanent jobs and they grow with that aspiration. Many have provided empirical evidences supporting motivational effect of entrepreneurial education even though formal entrepreneurship education is yet to gain traction in emerging economy, proliferation of which may entail prohibitively huge resources. MOOCs can obviate the need for infrastructure and other resources and can promote entrepreneurial education to a large audience of heterogeneous mix. We argue that MOOCs bring enormous advantages in terms of cost, flexibility of time, breaking geographical boundary, removing entry barrier and promoting entrepreneurial education to a large pool of students and professionals. It can bring about revolutionary change in the mind-set of a generation of youth motivating them to promote entrepreneurial ventures. MOOCs can also play a significant role in a new and fast evolving corporate strategic process of `corporate entrepreneurship' by offering flexible learning opportunity to related employees. Using data from various developed and emerging world we show in this paper that entrepreneurship education is essential for economic growth and quality of life of people of a nation. We also highlight some of the challenges in open teaching and outline the possible contents of such education.},

abstract={The assessment of a MOOC is an important part of the instructional design. It gives tools to students to self-evaluate through learning. The objective of this paper is to analyze the students´ assessment results from an Office Automation MOOC created at a Polytechnic Ecuadorian school. Students’ assessments evaluation will focus on exercises developed on the LMS (phase one), on a theoretical exam (phase two) and a face to face practical exam (phase three). The office automation MOOC assessment period corresponds to 2019-2t. The results showed that students don’t see the videos, they prefer to accomplish the activities in the MOOC to success phase one of the assessment; students know about general topics but don’t know about specific tools or applications, being Word application the less understood. Students mastered Excel more than PowerPoint. Additionally, the analysis of the activities of the MOOC in phase one, brought more comprehension of what happened in the phase three (face to face exam).},

abstract={User experience design is all about making a product by understanding its users and enables user to use a product easily. UX design is part of current industry standards which can be started along with requirement phase. Undergraduate students build products in project courses. Such courses include Software Life Cycle phases like Requirement gathering/ analysis, Design, Implementation and Testing but not UX design. Thus best of the project fail to generate a product that is usable. This paper presents a case study of minor project course which incorporated UX design in building mobile apps. UX is new technology and little known to instructors at colleges. So students were instructed to learn UX from MOOC on 'UX Design for Mobile Developer's', hosted by Udacity. Also, a workshop by industry expert in UX was conducted. The UX activities specified by MOOC were included as part course assessments. Through the UX design, students identified 3 to 4 user/ mobile device requirements and incorporated them in the implementation. The weightage of marks for UX design is 24%, which increased Design phase weightage to 30%. Finally students were able to launch product, 'KLE Tech STUDio' mobile-app. Attainment of design phase, UX, activities specified by MOOC, implementations are 7.2, 7.82, 6.8 and 7.5 respectively on the scale of 10. Further UX design can be included as part of Software Engineering course. Also, UX design can be tailored to any project course depending on the product being developed.},

pages={122-127},
abstract={MOOCs (massive open online courses) often use comprehensive exams and homework problem sets to assess students in their overall understanding of course material. The grades students receive on these tests and assignments determine whether they complete or become certified in course material. However, beyond receiving a certification, how do grades impact the learning behavior in students? Do students who receive poor grades actively change their overall activity to improve their grades? To better understand the impact of grades, we observe overall student activity on two MITx MOOCs for certified students and students who continuously participate in MOOC assignments. We use click stream data to compile the overall activity of a student and we use points earned divided by total possible points to calculate the students' grades. We observe that students with the highest levels of activity have some of the highest grades. We also observe that the difference in activity before and after the finalization of a grade (delta-activity) have greater variation as grade increases. Finally, we observe very little changes in grades (delta-grade) for certified students when visualized against delta-activity and that continuously participating students have greater grade changes compared to certified students.},

abstract={Time is a precious resource and it is always not enough to do the needful things. This necessity made the IT (Information technology) professionals to develop the Scripting Languages (SLs) to do their work in short time. As technology changes, computer processing speed is increased and supports variety of applications. This makes SLs more significant in development of future applications. SLs are mainly used for gluing applications and type less approach has made them as higher level programming languages. In this paper authors wish to convey their experience in designing curriculum and conducting the SLs laboratory course. A novel classification is presented to classify a large set of SLs, based on the utility of SLs. Basic scripts, Text processing Scripts, Glue languages, GUI scripting and Application specific languages categories are part of this nomenclature. In Outcome Based Education (OBE), assessment is one of the main parameters to check the learnability of the students. So OBE curriculum design inspire the authors to include assessment strategy step in the curriculum design. The Python scripting language is introduced for the first time in SLs laboratory by the authors to improve the learnability. They have also proposed pedagogical activities like multiple assignments, test plan writing, course project and multimedia book reading. The analysis of activities shows that 83% of students have passed with good grades and no failures in the course.},

This paper gives a topology for the system that is required and introduces self-managing properties that will add to the increased performance of the system in terms of speed, accuracy and security. With the aid of software agents continuously monitoring the progress of the entities in the system, we are able to introduce several self managing properties that govern the performance of the system as a whole. The software agents are modeled to be rational thinkers since every entity has a motive of performing its best. A game is simulated between two non cooperative agents as a case study and it is shown that the decision to move towards Nash Equilibrium serves better than any other random strategy.},

abstract={Due to their openness and low barriers to enroll, most Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) offer free access to knowledge for almost everyone. This attracts a large number of learners, each with their own individual intentions and motivations to join a course. However, personal support and guidance can almost never be provided at this scale. All learners have to follow the same usually weekly structured content and the learning success is only measured by the achievement of a certificate. To overcome this one-size-fits-all approach with technical means, we introduced a tool for Personalized Learning Objectives. This enables learners to achieve more individual objectives in courses, follow different learning paths, and link their motivations and intentions to the definition of learning success. Previous studies have already examined, among other aspects, the usefulness, acceptance, and achievement rates of learning objectives in MOOCs. In this complimentary research, the satisfaction of students with and without a selected learning objective is compared in a course on topics from the field of Design Thinking.},

abstract={As developments in educational technology continue to advance, the methods in which the courses are delivered and received by learners' evolved from board teaching to online courses. It is necessary to investigate and understand the progression and advancements in the quality of online education through the learning behaviour. The traditional way of using pre-post test scores and learners' feedback is not much helpful in assessing the online learning behavior. In the proposed research work, a learner's behavior prediction model is to be built using hybrid deep learning techniques. For this model building, various information such as facial expressions, time series Electroencephalography (EEG) data, clinical parameters like pulse rate, blood pressure, and skin temperature are acquired directly from the learner through sensors and other general information namely age, course, gender, location are included. Using this data collection, a hybrid model using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) is to be built and validated in real time for predicting the cognitive ability of a learner.},

abstract={Dyslexia is a learning disability that affects accurate and fluent word reading and spelling. Despite its prevalence, many primary school teachers and educators in India are unaware of dyslexia. Consequently, many students struggle through school without appropriate support. To facilitate identification of dyslexic students, we designed a screening test and administered it to 135 primary school children studying in Government and private schools in Haripad, a small town in Kerala State, India. The tasks included letter recognition, word recognition, recognition of rhyming words, spelling tests, and handwriting tasks in English and Malayalam (the local language), and assessed phonological awareness, visual processing, rapid naming, and motor skills. The students' answers were analyzed, mistakes were categorized, and possible causes for the mistakes were examined. This paper details the design of the screening test, its administration, the results, and conclusions drawn from the results.},

abstract={This paper discusses the design of a video blog to enhance the social presence of educators in MOOCs. Social presence is considered to be one of the critical factors in education, and MOOCs are no exception. However, in the most existing MOOCs, educators' social presence is limited due to its predefined, linear course structure, as well as text-based semi-synchronous conversation. Hence, this research proposes a daily video blog, which focuses on presenting: 1) Educators Biography; educators' background and experience in the subject area, 2) Educators Feedback; educators' response to learners' questions raised in the course, and 3) Educators Discussion; educators' debate on the latest trends surrounding the course topicto further augment educators' social presences. This paper studies the computer science course of FutureLearn which was conducted in October 2018 and April 2019. A series of short videos were uploaded per day on YouTube and shared with learners alongside the four weeks course. Through observing educators and learners' behavior, as well as conducting interviews with learners, the findings suggest a positive impact of a video blog on enhancing educators' social presence and further opens up new possibilities and new ways in designing MOOCs.},

abstract={Open pedagogy engages with learners as knowledge creators rather than knowledge consumers. Learners exhibit their learning through acts of knowledge creation. The constructivist learning theory suggests that learners construct knowledge and learn from their experiences and reflections. According to the constructive alignment framework, the acts of instruction consist of four components: educational outcomes, academic resources, instructional activities, and learning assessment. Management of these four components is the core of educational practices in higher education. In the context of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), the pattern of engagement changes according to the pedagogy deployed. This paper seeks to understand the practices of open pedagogy in two MOOCs that were offered in the Indian SWAYAM MOOC platform through the constructive alignment model. Anecdotal analysis shows that the openness in MOOCs can engage learners in a meaningful learning experience and prepare them for the 21st-century workplace.},

abstract={The 21st century has given rise to an economic and social system based on learning and, therefore, on the capacity to create and connect new and existing knowledge through people, rather than on the abundance of content. This change, compared to the industrial model, calls for a serious analysis of the need for flexible, fluid and transversal training in subjects or, rather, in competencies, from different fields. Learning systems have begun to address this challenge with massive open online courses. Nonetheless, MOOCs often replicate classical models of learning. They follow traditional learning paths based on the concept of “cycles”, with analysis of topics within a single subject area. We need to develop learning objects that can be (re)articulated and developed according to the binary logic of decomposition-aggregation, fragmentation-recomposition. In this way, we can propose a sort of multi-skilled knowledge and skills set that is agile and capable of selecting and communicating on different levels, able to deal convincingly with diverse subject areas, and that can be constantly updated. This is the only way for lifelong learning to take place, within a constant process of regeneration and multiplication, rather than through cycles. Digital learning can play a decisive role in responding to this challenge and, in the long term, will be indispensible. It is a model that follows and, in some way, supports or partially replaces the traditional University offering. But, more than that, digital learning provides new “granular” access to knowledge in response to the contingent needs of those people who “have to” access that knowledge.},

abstract={The hurdle problem in Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) is the poor performance when compared to monolingual performance in terms of average precision. The main reasons behind the poor performance of CLIR are query term mismatching, multiple representations of query terms and un-translated query terms. In this paper, we are putting our effort to solve the given problem which is discussed in detail. The limitations are needed to be addressed in order to increase the performance of the CLIR system. By analyzing those methods the architecture for English-Hindi CLIR system is proposed. Pre and post query expansion is used to improve the performance of English-Hindi CLIR system using English and Hindi WordNet, Local Expansion using initial query, definition based pre query expansion and keyword ranking. The pre and post query expansion helps to improving the performance of English-Hindi CLIR system and based upon past experiences the proposed approach retrieves more relevant information. All experiments are performed on FIRE 2010 (Forum of Information Retrieval Evaluation) datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed approach gives equal/better performance of English-Hindi CLIR system compared to monolingual performance and also helps in overcoming existing problems and outperforms the existing English-Hindi CLIR system in terms of average precision.},

abstract={Information and communication technology (ICT) is essential as infrastructure in the modern society. High level ICT professionals are strongly required. Universities, ICT industries and ICT qualification bodies are expected to collaborate to build a consistent system for education, training and evaluation to develop such high level ICT professionals. In this paper, we propose a web-based assessment tool named “cresie”. The tool maintains various types of standard requirement data such as those of college level computing curriculum, various ICT qualifications, and ICT task profiles. A student or an IT engineer can upload their self-evaluation data of achievement to cresie and compare the data with the requirement data. He (or she) can also compare the data with other cresie users. All of the evaluation and requirement data are described in terms of the common ICT body of knowledge (ICTBOK) which we have proposed in our previous paper. The system can also be used for curriculum assessment and requirement assessment for recruiting and evaluating IT professionals.},

abstract={In recent years, with increasing use of internet the computer systems are facing many number of security issues. Intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of the principal components of any information security system. Identification of anomalous activity in computer network is first step in identifying the threat to information system. Our focus is mainly on Genetic algorithm (GA) based anomaly detection technique, as GA is one of the most effective evolutionary techniques for machine learning. In this paper Genetic algorithm is applied for network intrusion detection. Our approach for optimization specifically focusing on false positive rate. Reduction in false positive rate also improves accuracy and performance. The limitation of other techniques of accuracy, false positive rates has been addressed in this paper. Experimental results show the efficient detection rates based on KDD99cup datasets which is a standard dataset for intrusion detection.},

abstract={Project based learning (PBL) in Engineering is an alternate for traditional pedagogy in which the learner will gain knowledge and skills by developing a solution for an authentic problem in a specified duration. Since it can be framed as continuous engaging activity, the number of topics of the course syllabi gets delivered in the process. A case study approach for a course titled `Digital Signal Processing (DSP)' is presented, as an example for PBL. The problem statement chosen for the PBL implementation is to illustrate a novel concept of Smart Headphones using Active Noise Cancellation and speech recognition. The PBL project is designed to address the contemporary issue of speech recognition in multimedia headphone to make it smart at a low cost. The prototype design based on principles of Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is achieved using a processor, TMS320C5416. The sub tasks of this project are correlated to different topics of the course of DSP syllabus. The sub task implementation, evaluation and mapping help to attain the outcomes of the course by means of PBL. The hands on experiments carried out with the DSP processor in implementing the proposed project in stages provide the better and ease of understanding of the course. An evaluation of stage wise implementation as compared to the corresponding evaluation modules of traditional DSP course delivery has been presented.},

abstract={Keeping in mind technological trends and student behaviour, higher educational institutes are adopting major changes in content delivery. The objective is to keep students engaged in the courses that they learn, which in turn would help them perform better academically. This paper describes students' online engagement in terms of their learning, participation and academic performance after teaching a course in a blended learning environment that consisted of teaching using learning management system (LMS), mobile computing systems, projected slides and white-board. It was found that there is a positive correlation between student engagement and the use of LMS. It was also observed that there is a strong positive correlation between the presence of various modules of the LMS in a course and the usage of the LMS by the students from outside the campus. Another finding made by the authors was that the off-campus usage and the on-campus usage of the LMS by the students are strongly correlated to each other. This study can be used by instructors and management of educational institutes to understand the significance of implementing learning management systems in order to provide a blended learning environment to the students.},

Despite intensified advantages and efficiency, people accessing MOOCs from the developing countries (especially India) do not count to a significant number. India being a promising abode of education too offers a prospective area to MOOCs for large scale implementation. But several factors and constraints like low digital literacy and lack of massive digital infrastructure hinder this process of extensive implementation of MOOCs. Even after all the prevalent constraints India leads the developing nations in terms of MOOCs enrollment. The authors have discussed some key issues of MOOCs especially in Higher Education system besides popularizing it extensively to utilize the potential education market of India to its fullest. The authors have also tried out to work with several possible way outs to extensive implementation in a virtual learning environment pertaining to an Indian perspective, besides viewing MOOCs as a route to ubiquitous learning.},

Open edX is largely used by thousands of organizations around the world. Nonetheless, one of the most challenging issues of employing Learning Analytics in Open edX platforms is having the ability to analyze "in-depth" log files. Open edX platform is deficient in providing the same features as the 'edX' system where the latter offers data packages and the prior struggles to explore advanced analytics.

abstract={By design, the computer science curriculum for undergraduate students in the United States does not include enough hands-on courses such as microcontrollers and embedded systems. It is difficult for students, especially the Distance Learners (DL) to appreciate the power of computer science as a problem-solving field without real-world experiments. Furthermore, students in computer science may drop-out or turn away from the field because it does not offer an opportunity for them to communicate with each other during online/traditional labs. In this paper, an active learning project-based approach in online/traditional computer science courses is introduced to make the courses' material more attractive to students from minorities. Students obtain a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world problems. Students will enjoy the challenges they face when developing solutions. This paper studies the impact of hands-on project-based learning using Raspberry Pi on students taking online and face-to-face computer science courses at Old Dominion University.},

abstract={It is evident, that the number of qualified teachers is less but the number of students willing to learn new technologies is increasing tremendously. Therefore, it is desired that alternative methods should be adopted to reduce the gap between the required number of qualified teachers and the actually available. As the technology is evolving rapidly, Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) appears to be an imminent concept which allows the students to use the IT infrastructure to learn while sitting at their home or workplace. MOOCs help the students to nurture problem-solving capabilities in them with the help of a plethora of online courses in diverse fields. Learners can choose courses of their interest and acquire a certificate of the same. This paper explores the concept and benefits of MOOCs in today's scenario, its advantages like freedom from geographic boundaries, flexibility, optimal cost, better educational outcomes. Further, this paper highlights challenges and limitations towards implementing MOOCs such as the dearth of infrastructure in developing countries, absence of proper assessment method, invalidity of such courses in conventional degree level programs, lack of practical sessions, and dropout rate. Significant developments in the field of MOOCs are ongoing in India under the banner of Ministry of Human Resource Development's project SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active-Learning for Young Aspiring Minds). Nature Journal survey has shown that India ranked second in the world to access MOOCs services. Indian Institute of Bombay and Indian Institute of Kharagpur started a program called T10KT (Train 10 Thousand (K) Teachers) to conduct large-scale teachers training and E-learning awareness program. This paper wraps up with some other developments implementing MOOCs in India with some pragmatic case studies.},

abstract={Our research group is currently engaged in an enhanced learning environment, within higher education, using Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in combination with Innovation-Based Learning (IBL). Both approaches to learning when arranged correctly, improve students learning and engagement towards the course. When using IBL, one of the main problems that students experience is the selection of their class project. We propose a methodology based on funding opportunity announcements (FOA) to aid in the selection process. Student groups are able to quickly compare and match their skills and interests to market demand as expressed by groups such as NIH or NSF. The students in the class experience a blended approach; they collaborate online and in-class, and they apply knowledge acquired from online content to their main project. In this blended approach, FOAs act as a catalyst to students' learning; it both focuses them at the beginning and motivates them throughout the course. Students in this MOOC-enabled learning ecosystem grow in their intrinsic motivation and engagement. Furthermore, FOAs project selection solves scalability issues when dealing with inter-disciplinary projects and availability of proper experts/mentors for students. This tailored combination improves efficiency and targets project's relevance, which makes it very attractive to higher education administrators.},

abstract={In India, there is a strong need of reform measures to improve the quality of medical education being imparted in various medical colleges and institutions. This is partly aggravated by the shortage of healthcare practitioners. As a solution for improving the quality of medical education, an emerging form of eLearning, namely, Massive Open Online Courseware (MOOC) could be used as a potential tool. With its varied advantages, MOOCs have a wide acceptance amongst the global community. MOOC replaces the traditional brick and mortar classrooms by providing an open online knowledge repository and enables a collaborative learning environment. However, for MOOCs to be accepted as a medium for imparting medical education in India, it is necessary that MOOCs is recognised by all the medical colleges and institutions. MOOCs would not only improve the quality of medical education but also, as a spin off, would result in the improvement of healthcare service delivery, thereby benefitting each and every citizen of India.},

abstract={This paper presents the usabilities of a newly developed web based virtual laboratory package as a self-learning tool in association with online courses with the facility for evaluation of user assignments without the intervention of the instructor. This virtual lab contains a hierarchical module level logic design tool equipped with a logic simulator, a set of pre-designed experiments and also the facility to add new experiments to enhance learning. The tool contains a repertoire of components and design functionalities to aid learning through experiments. For complex experiments, such as CPU design, the tool provides an interface for specifying the controller abstractly as a control state chart. All the experiments can be conducted on a regular desktop or a laptop computer and can be saved with user identification at any point and resumed later. This virtual lab has been successfully deployed to support several of courses at IIT Kharagpur. Additionally, workshops to familiarize this system to teachers and students in several colleges have been conducted. Feedback from an academic institute conducting the lab with online courses indicating satisfactory usability has been gathered.},

abstract={In recent years e-learning environments got more and more popular, which resulted in a diverse, fast-growing community that among other anticipate individualisation and flexibility in means of customer support and recommendations. Scalability is required when the number of learners and the number of learning resources increase. This work targets dialogue-based systems used for Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platforms to reduce human resources for answering technical support requests. The dialogue-based system must be available 24/7 and response immediately mainly to platform- specific frequently asked questions which were identified by an analysis of needs on existing support requests. Based on this comprehensive concepts, prototypes were implemented to prove the feasibility and explore the possibilities. The achievements of the deployment of a dialogue-based system for a MOOC platform were evaluated with well-defined metrics. These metrics showed, that even when deploying the most basic version of a dialogue-based system, the number of support requests created is reduced and thus the costly manual effort.},

abstract={MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) are definitely one of the best approach to support the international agenda about inclusive and equitable education and lifelong learning opportunities for all (SDG4) [1]. A great deal universities and institutions offer valuable free courses to their numerous students and to people around the word through MOOC platforms. However, because of huge number of learners and data generated, learner’s behaviour in those platforms remain a kind of black box for learners themselves and for courses instructors who are supposed to tutor or monitor learners in the learning process. Therefore, learner do not receive sufficient support from instructors and from their peers, during the learning process [2]. This is one the main reasons that lead to high dropout, low completion and success rate observed in the MOOCs. Many research work have suggested descriptive, predictive and prescriptive models to address this issue, but most of these models focus on predicting dropout, completion and/or success, and do not generally pay enough attention to one of the key step (learner behaviour), that comes before, and can explain dropping out and failure. Our research aims to develop a deep learning model to predict learner behaviour (learner interactions) in the learning process, in order to equip learners and course instructors with insight understanding of the learner behaviour in the learning process. This specific paper will focus on analysing relevant algorithms to develop such model. For this analysis, we used data from UNESCO-IICBA (International Institute for Capacity Building in Africa) MOOC platform, designed for teacher training in Africa, and then we examine many types of features: geographical, social behavioural and learning behavioural features. Learner’s behaviour being a time series Big data, we built the predictive model using Deep Learning algorithms for better performance and accuracy (Thanks to the power of deep learning) compared to baseline Machine learning algorithms. Time series data is best handled by recurrent neural networks (RNN) [3], so, we choose RNN and implemented/tested the three main architectures of RNN: Simple RNNs, GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) RNNs and LSTM (Long short-term memory) RNNs. The models were trained using L2 Regularization, based on the predictions results, we unexpectedly found model with simple RNNs produced the best performance and accuracy on the dataset used than the other RNN architectures. We had couple of observations, example: we saw a correlation between video viewing and quiz behaviour and the participation of the learner to the learning process. This observation could allow teachers to provide meaningful support and guidance to at risk or less active students. We also observed that, the shorter the video or the quiz, the more the viewer. We conclude that we could use learner video or quiz viewing behaviour to predict his behaviour concerning other MOOC contents. These results suggest the need of deeper research on educational video and educational quiz designing for MOOCs.},

The tool visualises learners' progression through the learning material and their interaction with discussion forums. These diagrams can be filtered based on user demographies and behaviours. Automated clustering of users based on behaviour metrics is available to provide suggestions of different learner behaviours. Statistical tests are also included to allow hypothesis exploration by researchers.

abstract={In conventional class room teaching, teacher gives a lecture and students watch and listen. It has been proved that students retain the concepts for longer time, only when they involve in doing i.e. learning by doing. Hence it is necessary to understand the next generation students, learning styles and implement some active learning strategies to make them involved in the learning process. This paper introduces some of the active learning strategies which are implemented in the engineering class room of a particular institute. This paper also discusses various challenges in implementing active learning and benefits of active learning strategies in detail, in contrast to conventional passive learning methodology.},

abstract={Outcomes Based Education (OBE), is penetrating the Engineering Education system at an increasing pace. Today, every activity, every course, is measured by the Outcomes being addressed. The outcomes of a program are the set of competencies acquired by the student at the time of completion of the program. The broad guidelines for desired competencies are defined by the accreditation bodies. The focus of this work is to present possible methods of introducing `self-study', in the engineering education so that it eventually leads to `life-long-learning'. The suggested methods can be included in any course and when successfully implemented in most courses, leads to the graduating engineer understanding the need for `life-long learning', and it is expected that the engineer shall engage in independent study through-out his professional career. The work also discusses the role of the faculty in developing the `self-study' component in a course. We present few examples of having integrated this component through few courses of the curriculum through a suitable definition of the Course Outcome.},

abstract={Most of the students are forced to take different courses based on their parent's interest, not of their interest. Some students are selecting their courses without knowing their inner ability. In this paper, how the student should select the different courses based on their learning styles in different levels is derived. This is achieved by eliminating the outliers in collected data from students. Since the data collected from students based on their learning styles is categorical, outlier detection analysis for categorical data is used to eliminate outliers from this data. These outliers are occurred while collecting data from students. Because some students are very peculiar, some students are not interested to reveal their data, some students may give wrong answers for any questionnaire by bias and some students may give incomplete data due to lack of time. The data is collected from B.Tech students from different colleges for experiments. After eliminating outliers from this data by proposed outliers' techniques, different classifiers are applied to frame set of rules to select suitable courses based on their learning styles. The results are better when proposed method is applied.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to explore the determinants of learner satisfaction in blended learning environment by examining learner readiness variables. This research examined the relationship between learner readiness and learner satisfaction and identified the predictors of learner satisfaction. The participants were 325 undergraduate students who took a blended-format courses in one of the private universities in Malaysia. Data was collected using an online survey. The analysis of the quantitative data indicated that learner satisfaction has statistically positive relationship with learner readiness. This means that students who perceived high level of readiness to learn in blended courses tended to be more satisfied with their courses than those who perceived low levels of readiness. Additionally, the outcomes from the multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that there are five critical factors of learner satisfaction namely performance expectation, self-directed learning, online communication self-efficacy, motivation for learning and learner control The findings strongly indicated the importance of learner readiness in predicting and understanding learner satisfaction in blended learning environment. The implications and limitations were also discussed in this paper. This study highlights the importance for institutions and instructors to cater for learner satisfaction in implementing blended learning to optimize students' experiences so that learning outcomes and satisfaction could be enriched.},

abstract={With the emergence of a knowledge driven economy, these are times of brisk business for institutions providing training to professionals. The flipside of this is that there is an ever increasing demand on them to create a growing number of new courses, and serve an ever increasing flow of customers ata faster and faster pace. In its various flavours, this problem is faced by MOOC/online course providers, training departments of large organisations, and modern universities which offer short term courses for corporate audience as well. Hence, there is a need to optimally utilise all available resources: time of trainer/trainee/organisation, infrastructure etc. while designing and conducting training courses. Current practice is to do this manually. In this paper, we build a case for automation of this process. We present mathematical models for 3 problems in this space. Once a mathematical model of a problem is developed, it becomes possible to carry out several analyses on these problems, design automated solutions. As is revealed from the mathematical models, the problem of training curriculum design has already grown beyond the complexity that a human expert can handle efficiently. With every passing day, the gap will only increase. Our simulations establish the efficiency and effectiveness of the solutions we provide.},

abstract={Many of the demands of scale appear at odds with quality, such as in the case of online MOOC degree programs. This paper presents research that focuses on reducing this dichotomy. Examination essays are important learning tools in for-credit courses. Psychology studies show they drive deeper learning strategies and invoke higher levels of cognitive processing in students. High-quality feedback is another critical aspect of students' learning in advanced education. Key components of high-quality feedback are how expeditiously feedback is presented and how unambiguous it is. Examination essays are time-consuming for educators to grade, and at scale this may create an incentive for superficial feedback that may also reach students in a less than ideal turnaround time. This imposes clear scalability constraints and a potential decrease in course quality in online for-credit MOOC programs. We propose an annotation-free artificial intelligence-based approach for the automatic generation of examination essay rubrics and its subsequent utilization as part of high-quality feedback to students. It utilizes a combination of the natural language processing techniques TextRank and semantic similarity for automatic rubric generation and concept map creation for feedback presentation. The feedback is immediately available upon essay submission and offers the student a conceptual analysis of the submitted essay against the assignment's learning objectives.},

Since, the effort required developing or test software shall depend on various major contributing factors like, therefore, the proposed measure first estimates the change type of any software, make test cases for any software, then calculate execution complexity of any software and tester rank. In general, the regression testing takes more time and cost to perform it. Therefore, the effort estimation in regression testing is utmost required in order to compute man-hour for any software. In order to analyze the validity of the proposed test effort estimation measure, the measure is compared for various ranges of problem from small, mid and large size program to real life software projects. The result obtained shows that, the proposed test measure is a comprehensive one and compares well with other prevalent measures proposed in the past.},

There is a growing gap between the average researcher (who does not have access to proprietary data) and the ready availability of data sets for analysis. Most research papers studying and predicting student performance in MOOCs are done on proprietary data sets that are not anonymized (de-identified) or released for general study. There are no standardized tools that provide a gateway to access usable data sets; instead, the researcher must navigate a maze of sites with different data structures and varying data access policies. To our knowledge, no open data sets are being produced, and have not been since 2016. The authors survey the history of MOOC data sharing, identify the few available open data sets, and discuss a path forward to increase the reproducibility of MOOC research.},

abstract={The real classroom conditions are very challenging for the teachers and administrators because of having the diversified students with and without special needs in an inclusive classroom. It seems like the different colours of flowers in a single flask. To tackle the individual differences and to maximize the educational achievement of the every student it becomes necessary to upgrade the educational programs and course content in accordance with the diversified classroom situations. Diversified courseware technology honours the individual difference and satisfied the specific educational need of each student. Diversified Courseware technology enhances self-learning to students, teachers and trainers with the help of diagrams, animation, assessment tools, teaching notes and exercises. It has been observed that the usage of computer learning and courseware technology in education system has increased dramatically since its inception. The time and place is no more big issue in communication because of internet. However, more work is required to be done in the area of graphics to improve Diversified courseware technology to enhance the Educational Achievement of Students with and without Special Needs in the Inclusive Classroom. Through this paper we try to focus on the requirements and the challenges in the field of Diversified Courseware technology to enhance the Educational Achievement of Students with and without Special Needs in the Inclusive Classroom.

abstract={Teaching and learning is an important process in any educational system to evaluate the performance of both students and the entire system. To meet the great demands for educators and to fill the gap between teaching-learning process and learning outcomes, a great shift is required in an assessment system. Assessment being an important performance measure, it should give an opportunity to students to explore their thinking skills. The present study focuses on analyzing the thinking skills present in an assessment using revised Blooms Taxonomy standards. Three different categories of courses have been considered for the present analysis to study the different thinking skills that are present in an assessment paper. It also analyzes the complexity level present in an assessment and to know the quality of the system. Present study uses a weight-based data mining approach to classify the Blooms categories and the thinking levels associated with that. This study also reveals that the identifying the thinking levels is not same for all kinds of course types.},

pages={200-205},
abstract={After being used to a procedural style of programming, programming in an object-oriented style seems to be difficult. The problem analysis skill is also important where it leads to designing solution for complex problems. In the process of problem analysis, it is big challenge for the students to identify classes, attributes, methods and association between the classes from a given problem statement/Scenario and then mapping to program code. The problem analysis is part of design thinking, where it consists of five phases Empathy (Emphasize), Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test. In this course we implemented a modified standard "Design Thinking Framework" through structured enquiry assessment, in our framework few phases are overlapping and it is defined using following phases-1. Define, 2. Ideate & Prototype, 3. Test. This framework is add-on to our previous practice where a comprehensive tutorial for "Object Oriented Thinking" is conducted first to minimize students difficulties. Also it includes "laboratory experiment categorization" to help students in improving problem analysis and design skills. By using the above said approaches, it is observed that the students are able to use object oriented concepts efficiently to solve problems, design solutions and performed better in semester end examination.},

In order to get widely adopted, UDT should be used as an underlying protocol for various existing applications like FTP, TELNET etc., which are currently based on standard TCP. Therefore, it is important to carryout detailed analysis in order to port existing TCP based applications over UDT. Through this paper we have carried out detailed source code analysis of FTP and TELNET and identified various issues in porting them to UDT. We have also proposed the required changes to be carried out at UDT framework in order to address the identified porting issues. Detailed performance analysis of TCP and UDT based applications is also presented in this paper.},

abstract={As the educational organizations worldwide are moving towards bringing education experience on Internet, via Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on Massive Open Online Education Platforms (MOOEPs), the retention of the enrolled students throughout the course is still a huge challenge. Although the online education has an immensely noble aim, i.e., to provide free\less expensive quality education to everyone, but if the existing MOOCs are upgraded to more captivating environment for users, a drastic increase in the user engagement in the course can be achieved, and hence MOOCs' providers can reach their ultimate goal in a more ubiquitous manner. In this paper it is suggested that this divide between a MOOC and user's engagement can be bridged with Gamification. Gamification is the use of game design elements in non-game contexts. Here an experimental environment was setup to compare the results of a small vocabulary course distributed among 100 candidates, and a comparative analysis between the gamified learning method and conventional learning method has been done. After the completion of the course a small survey was also taken from the candidates who had gamified tool. The results show that if the learning platform is gamified, it does not only drastically increase the user enrolment but also increase user engagement throughout the course. Gamification also makes learning, a unique and amusing experience.},

Its impact can be perceived in the most varied aspects, as the challenging economic problems, the increasing cases of psychological issues, and obviously, the serious crisis faced by health systems worldwide. In this context, most students at different educational levels had their activities interrupted or affected, bringing up an intensive discussion about remote learning. In this work, it has been observed the social reality of the students in the Federal Institute of Rio de Janeiro, Paracambi campus (Rio de Janeiro - Brazil) regarding their family financial situation and emotional conditions during the pandemic, which would severely influence students’ performance if they are subjected to remote learning courses.

Furthermore, it provides high level system architecture to highlight key aspects of the technology infrastructure and the functionality of the software system. The rationale of the approach follows the tenets of several converging theoretical perspectives emphasizing the value of learners' dialogue and constructive argumentation as knowledge building processes during collaborative activities. The MOOC teacher (domain expert) is expected to play a key role by entering in the system conceptual links that guide the agent to make relevant questioning interventions. Thus, the agent tool is mediating group-teacher interactions in a MOOC environment aiming to increase the transactive quality of peer dialogue. The paper discusses also the `Academically Productive Talk' model that provides the basis for the agent interventions and the major software components of the system, including the colMOOC Editor and the colMOOC Player.},

Learners' familiarity with the industry-relevant IT concepts is essential for the graduates of hospitality when they are embarking into an industry. ICT has changed the way how the teacher and learners interact with each other. Successful integration of ICT in teaching depends upon learners' attitude towards innovation. The study aimed to analyse the students' usage pattern and their attitude towards ICT in hospitality education. The participants of the study were the students of hospitality education program, who have been enrolled for a four-year undergraduate hospitality management program in a private university, located in Karnataka, India. An online survey was conducted to collect the data from the students. The findings of the study revealed that most frequently used ICT tool by hospitality students in learning are e-mail systems, presentation programs, and the word processing programs. There is a difference in the attitude of male and female respondents on the usage of ICT in hospitality education. The finding also shows that hospitality students have a strong preference towards the usage of ICT in their learning.},

abstract={e-Learning is the use of information and communication technology to enable people to learn anytime and anywhere. E-learning is a support tool for educators as well as a medium of delivery of any-time, any-where delivery of content to a dispersed learner community. Emotions are also important in teaching and learning and often find expression in particular ways, such as interactions with others and motivation in learning. Although both emotions and interest can increase learners' likelihood to engage in traditional learning, little is known about the influence of emotions and interest in learning activities in a digital environment. The aim of the research is to develop a computational model for recognizing learner emotions in online learning. Therefore, the study has developed Online Achievement Emotion Questionnaire (AEQ) tool which is suited for the online learning environment. Also the study has identified six parameters which represent the learner's level of learning during the learning experience. Finally the study has analysed and evaluated the correlation between the learner emotions and the observed behaviour. This research study therefore developed a novel model of affective online learning which can be use as a tool to recognise online learner's emotions with regard to the performance in learning.},

abstract={Cloud based systems are more popular in today's world but fault tolerance in cloud is a gigantic challenge, as it affects the reliability and availability for the end users. A number of tools have been deployed to minimize the impact of faults. A fault tolerable system ensures to perform continuous operation and produce correct results even after the failure of components up to some extent. More over huge amount of data in the cloud cannot monitor manually by the administrator. Automated tools, dynamic deploying of more servers are the basic requirements of the todays cloud system in order to handle unexpected traffic spikes in the network. This proposed work introduces an autonomic prospective on managing the fault tolerance which ensure scalability, reliability and availability. HAProxy has been used to provide scaling to the web servers for load balancing in proactive manner. It also monitors the web servers for fault prevention at the user level. Our framework works with autonomic mirroring and load balancing of data in database servers using MySQL master- master replication and Nginx respectively. Administrator keeps an eye on working of servers through Nagios tool 24×7 monitoring can't be done manually by the service provider. The proposed work has been implemented in the cloud virtualization environment. Experimental results show that our framework can deal with fault tolerance very effectively.},

pages={138-144},
abstract={In Finland and globally, many university teachers are teaching without pedagogical training. Employee training courses on pedagogy are offered via contact teaching, thus excluding potential students who are too busy to attend sessions at a specific time and place. In addition, majority of teaching is in Finnish, even though, for example, in the University of Turku, 10% of all employees are international. Due to limited teaching resources, university pedagogical studies used to be only available for university staff members who have teaching duties, excluding the majority of doctoral students from the courses. The UNIPS learning platform, developed by eight Finnish universities, was created to solve these problems. The current study investigates the impact UNIPS solution has on the above mentioned issues by looking quantitatively (N=590) at (1) which departments participants come from? (2) Are participants' doctoral students or university employees and (3) what are the age and gender distributions of participants? In addition, participants' perceptions of UNIPS studies are analyzed qualitatively. Based on the findings, UNIPS courses and similar MOOCs seem a promising way to support teachers' pedagogical training. They can not only increase the diversity of offered studies, but also help create a more inclusive environment at universities.},

abstract={There are a large number of foreign language learners in China. Lots of research has been done on how to improve foreign language learning efficiency, but in reviewing the foreign language learning researches, it can be easily seen that the cultural effects on foreign language learning have not been given its due attention. Much of the research has been done within the scope of particular theories. This thesis attempts to explore the science of foreign language learning from the perspective of cultural effects on language learners, especially the effects of culture on foreign language learning beliefs. The efficiency of foreign language learning can be improved by improving learning strategies, which in turn are determined by language learning beliefs. The language learning beliefs are adversely affected by such cultural factors in Chinese culture as patterns of social hierarchy, face, collectivism and past oriented time concept. These cultural patterns help explain the existing language learning beliefs in China. Understanding the effects of these cultural patterns on foreign language learning beliefs, foreign language teachers can better understand students' learning beliefs and help students in turn with the evaluation of their learning beliefs; students of foreign languages can develop their own independent understanding of the foreign language, avoiding some false language learning beliefs.},

Efforts are being made to develop and foster crowd sourced massive open repositories of learning objects, which can be tapped to author courses for diverse learners with varied backgrounds dynamically. Developing systems to author and deliver such courses has been of rising importance to contemporary researchers and this paper proposes an efficient context-aware open e-learning environment to do the same. The learning objects having high aptness to the particular course and high content-based predicted rating pertaining to the particular learner's preferences are picked from the open repository and the course structure is modeled using communicating dynamic Petri nets. Ratings and feedback from the user are obtained during presentation, based on which the course delivery is made adaptive. Rating prediction through Collaborative filtering is used for this purpose. The ratings are also used to implicitly learn the learner's preferences and to establish an aptness score for each learning object.},

abstract={The society that we are interested in living today breathes and, more and more, is in conformity with a globalization that is too often likely to resemble an awkward attempt at value and cultural uniformity, for an apparent inclusion.If on the one hand the technologies are there for a daily globalization, as if easy knowledge were implicitly included, on the other hand precisely this possibility of spreading knowledge within a process of reflection on the dimension of inclusion that brings with it.The reflection that you want to ask comes from the extensive experience in the field of MOOC and their progressive use. A commitment not only in the field of training but also, and increasingly, for the diffusion of knowledge.The dissemination of knowledge, which can be used with the MOOC, is aimed at promoting the direct use, enhancement and use of knowledge for the social, cultural and economic development of society; this now stated is what for the Italian University is the "third mission" after the fundamental objectives of teaching and research.We therefore want to highlight how the MOOC and the OPEN approach have what in economics is called ROI (Return Of Investment) in terms of inclusion and digital citizenship, to also lead to an intercultural dimension.A perspective that does not lead to defining paths of uniformity but paths of inclusion represented by discovering interconnections even before common points.The spirit that permeates this work can be summarized in a thought by the French biologist Jean Rostand "All human diversity is the product of the almost infinite variety of gene exchanges. We are all made up of the same chromosomal powder; none of us has a single grain that can claim as his. It is our whole that belongs to us and makes us ours: we are an original mosaic of banal elements" [1].},

A case study of how, MOOC on 'User Experience (UX) provided by Udacity for mobile app' was utilized to enhance the quality of student projects, is presented in this paper. Most of the time, MOOCs are provided by the global experts who teach the course in a best possible way. Also, MOOC directly helps in attaining lifelong learning skills. MOOC can be used in many ways to deliver a curriculum. This paper focuses on, how the learning's and activities specified by MOOC on UX is included as part of student project course, its assessment, evaluation and results. The student projects are mobile apps specified by a company, which emphasized much on UX, the latest industry need. Therefore students were instructed to register for the MOOC on UX and learn on their own. Each student teams had to do UX design as specified in MOOC and same UX design activities were included as a part of project course assessment and evaluated. As a result, students were able to discover additional requirements addressing mobile UX and perform UX based design and construct according to it. These activities helped to attain ABET criteria 'i' with attainment 7.82 on scale of 10.},

abstract={According to an air quality monitoring survey done by Greenpeace, India has PM2.5 levels, which is arguably higher than safety limits. It is essential to impart environmental education to denizens of India. Previous solutions include usage of Mobile Apps to aid in sharing Air Quality Index as a part of EGovernance initiatives. To aid Government in boosting the efficacy of E-Governance service for pollution control and provide environmental education, we intend to design an intelligent framework that utilizes social networks. In this paper, we have proposed an automated framework for pollution control E-Governance service which takes the user profiles on social networks and data collected from Internet of Things (IoT) based air pollution sensors as input. The prototype utilizes Machine learning algorithm to avoid human intervention and social networks as a platform to aid in outreaching environmental education to large masses of people.},

abstract={Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is a network comprises of mobile nodes connected without any centralized administration. Each node in the network has the ability to share a large number of objects with other nodes. The nodes are connected with other nodes to forward a message to other nodes until the search for node that desire meets. This paper represents a new replication method to recover the performance in distributed system. Objects are replicated on different nodes in the network to minimize the search for an object. It is observed that mobility of nodes predicted using SOM (Self Organizing Maps) technique provides less accuracy. This paper represents an algorithm that uses the network parameters as input condition to replicate objects into the nodes. The decision for each node will be taken by gathering the input conditions and feed to the Hopfield Neural Network. It is view that it will provide more accuracy and improve the performance.},

abstract={The aim of this work is to present an innovative framework to enhanced learner engagement and motivation on massive open online learning environments. The paper explores on the impact of applying Educational Data Mining in combination with Learning Analytics techniques, through a framework called Digital Learning Ecosystem (DLE) to provide students a complete and different learning experience along the course. This work presents in detail the design and applying of a DLE with different strategies to help students overcome the learning process difficulties that arise in a massive, open, and online course. The proposed framework is based on the importance of creating engaging experiences before, during and after a course completion to increase learners' participation and reduce dropout rates. This study analyzed data obtained from edX course “Java Fundamentals for Android Development” developed by a group of Professors of the Faculty of Computer Engineering, and the Department of Research and Development (GES) of Galileo University. The data set consisted of a post-course survey, participants demographic, solution activities submission, and final grades. The results obtained are analyzed in terms of student perceived usefulness, motivation, student's usage of tools and students' attitude towards DLE, degree of satisfaction, and engagement.},

Using a comparative framework, we map the expected outcomes of higher education against popular global MOOCs and the recently launched Indian version - SWAYAM to evolve the strengths and weaknesses inherent to both modes. Global MOOC platforms score highest on student centric parameters including learning design, opportunities for lifelong learning, better accessibility. The strength of SWAYAM lies in its qualitative evaluation systems as well as recognition of credits, equity of access and affordability. Traditional HEIs have a clear edge over global MOOCs and SWAYAM in terms of long term impact on citizen and society building and shaping individual opinions.},

abstract={Mobile applications for MOOC platforms often can download learning material — namely videos — for later usage without the need for an Internet connection. As learners want to perform such data-intensive tasks with a WiFi connection, manual planning is required. By automating the download management, learners can be supported by always having video material available independent of the current Internet connection. This work examines the current download behavior shown in three MOOC courses. Hereby, influencing factors like the dependence on time and date, as well as the network state were analyzed. The results show that learners are already aware of data-intensive learning activities. They mostly download videos when connected to a WiFi network and consume pre-downloaded video content when using a cellular connection. An estimate of the potential for automated downloads using a simplified approach revealed the possibility of making an additional 19% of the video consumption network independent. The download behavior in the three courses examined differed noticeably so that automated downloads should be seen as an additional feature that can be activated per course.},

abstract={Higher education in general and professional education in particular, graduates have to acquire required knowledge, specific skills and attitudes. Project work is one of the major components that aims at inculcating most of the required attributes in any undergraduate program. One of the most important activities of the practicing engineer is finding solutions to problems that arise by applying his knowledge and converting physical principles into useful devices/solutions. This involves creativity, imagination and reasonably strong analytical ability. These qualities can be nurtured in a systematic way. Realizing the importance of these aspects, project work plays a major role in achieving the above objective. The quality of the project work depends upon its selection process, size and complexity and support of the faculty-mentor. Some of the reputed institutes such as IITs follow the standard assessment mechanism to evaluate the quality of project work, but there is lot of scope for improvement. This paper discusses various aspects of improving assessment methods of project work and demonstrates an outcome based assessment method to evaluate the quality of project work in alignment with the recent guidelines introduced by National Board of Accreditation (NBA) for undergraduate programs.},

To choose suitable course it is necessary to assess their learning styles and inner ability. In this paper the learning styles of students have been assessed based on Felder and Silverman's “Index of Learning Styles questionnaire”. While collecting the data from students using ILS questionnaire, some inconsistent data may be generated due to many reasons. To build correct decision making system to select suitable courses it is needed to eliminate all such inconsistencies from the original data. The data collected from this questionnaire is a categorical data. Different outlier analysis techniques for categorical data have been used to eliminate outliers in this paper. Nearly five hundred records are collected from various engineering colleges from different branches of engineering. After eliminating the inconsistencies from data, different classification models have been built and their accuracies at different levels are compared.},

abstract={Globalization, Customization and Web 2.01 are having substantial effects in the Education sector. For this, the government of India has taken strong steps towards Collaborative E-Learning which yields significant social, educational, financial and research profits. The learning infrastructure has improved many folds providing easy access to innovative technologies. But, for its utmost utilization, there is need to identify the intended learners and their cognitive requirements to produce precise E-Content and Content Management Systems (CMS)2 to match the learner's needs, cognitive ability and learning attitude. Keeping this in view, the present study suggests a cognitive agent3 based expert system for collaborative E-Learning. The system drives on learner's cognitive ability. It simulates the human thought process during teaching-learning activity and collaborative learning; and thus, provides the relevant, unambiguous E-Content. The system can be used to obtain an insight to the learner's cognitive aspects and willingness to learn in social interactive environment. Based on the empirical data gathered, the system instructs the learner for self paced learning or social interactive learning. The system is referred as CAESMCE-Learning (Cognitive Agent based Expert System for Metacognitive and Collaborative E-Learning). The agent acts as a software artifact that exhibits intelligent behavior in a very complex domain like human learning where the system attempts to model the cognitive process associated with learning. The system is like an intelligent agent which is reactive, instructable, adaptive and cognitive. The property of instructability is important since by allowing the instructional designer to feed the agent with new knowledge during its execution, it helps to solve the knowledge acquisition problem. The system models human intelligence and human perspective of the world using BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) Model. In the context of this study, Metacognitive E-Learning is a computer-supported self paced collaborative learning approach which assists the learner to become more aware of the learning attitude and learning requirements and thus, make strategies for learning based on the experience. Metacognitive approach can help the learners to help themselves. This system can be used to determine the learning pattern and thought process of the learner during the learning activity. It can be used to study the impact of self paced and collaborative E-Learning on learner's cognitive capability. It is no longer confined to the delivery of instructional packets delivered to learners and then evaluated by the teacher. Now, the emphasis is on self paced social learning using social software such as blogs, wikis, podcasts. It works on the principle that the knowledge is socially constructed and learning takes place through conversations about content and grounded interaction about problems and actions. It is believed that one of the best ways to learn something is to teach it to others. Cognitive agents are best suited to solve such complicated problems in the domain that requires extensive human expertise and time. They simulate the human reasoning process with the help of knowledge base and inference engine. Education system would be revolutionized with the use of Cognitive agent based systems for learning, teaching and planning. Metacognition refers to the knowledge concerning one's own cognitive processes and products or anything related to them [5].},

abstract={Universities are pressed to update their educational processes in face of the changing students' needs, the companies and industries requirements and the surrounding society evolving context. Never has this challenge been so dramatic and so immediate as it is now, in this COVID-19 pandemic! Much of the burden to adapt the teaching processes and the learning methodologies has fallen onto teachers that were required to improve their pedagogical and technical competences to be able to handle the present societal needs. Teachers must now be able to blend online activities with face-to-face teaching and to reuse existing open contents into their teaching practices to adapt efficiently to this new reality. This paper analyses and discusses the needs of teachers in such contexts, namely when Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are blended with other forms of learning. This study was conceived and designed before the current pandemic but it has been rendered even more relevant by this situation.},

abstract={The major challenge of Team Based Learning (TBL) or Group learning is its Design and Implement that assess the student's knowledge and skills. The challenge also includes designing assessment to grade the students based on their contribution to the team performance. Teacher assessing the student's performance in team is a teacher biased process. Therefore Peer evaluation can be included as part of TBL assessment. Peer review is considered as transparent and efficient technique to assess individual in team. But it has also been criticized with respect to fairness. This paper proposes Trusted Relative Peer Review (TRPR) which reduces the disadvantages of peer review to greater extent. It includes two reviews i) Team's Guide review ii) Peer review. The trustworthiness of peer review is decided based correlation of Guides and Peer reviews, depending on which each student is rated relatively for 100 points. After comparisons of results, 65% student teams peer reviews were found to be not trustworthy, which are corrected through proposed TRPR. This review is accepted by 54-58% of students and trusted it. TRPR helped to measure "ability to function in a team" with attainment of 7.7 on the scale of 10. TRPR contributes to the success of TBL implementation in greater extent by overcoming the drawbacks of peer review. It influences individual student's marks based on their contributions. Therefore it ensures students contribute in group work resulting in students learning. Although TRPR is hectic, future work shall try to make it simple.},

abstract={With the enormous increase in Massive Open Online Courses across different platforms and domains, the course related information is being overloaded. It becomes a very tedious task for the learners to search for the required courses matching their individual goals, knowledge, and interest. MOOCs recommender system plays a vital role by easing this task and providing courses of interest within an efficient time frame. This paper proposes an effective MOOC recommender system with the help of various data mining techniques. It encashes upon the fact that the learners involved in the MOOCs can be easily divided into two categories of active and passive learners based upon their activity logs. It first channelizes the learners into these categories and then provides separate recommendations by applying different data mining approaches. Through this technique, an average accuracy of 92 percent was achieved in case of active learners for the course recommendations.},

abstract={During the last decades, our society is witnessing an authentic revolution that, in a dizzying manner has deeply influenced, modified, and transformed the way of life of human beings. This constant and unstoppable revolution is transmuting all areas of our life: social, cultural, personal, labor, economic, training, etc. This new society is characterized by a high generation of knowledge and the constant and fluid processing of information. In this macro-context, the MOOC phenomenon emerged. MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) courses are based on the principles of massive, free access to all materials and resources offered online. This new didactic path can be constituted in an innovative techno-social tendency, especially oriented in the panorama of Higher Education to stimulate university improvement, open opportunities at the same time for education and training or, simply, derive towards a new business model for the universities. In addition to being an entry point for the popularization of science and knowledge, the future possibilities are enormous and are being studied in all their various dimensions. Many initiatives as a result have been developed to implement this new form of education. MOOC Courses and the Future of Higher Education presents the latest research theories and current examples of MOOC courses practices in Higher Education. The chapters represent an extensive assortment of interpretations and practices examples of MOOC courses, across areas as varied as teaching methodologies, instructional innovations, educational technology, etc. This work is structured in three sections, the first one covers the university institution in the knowledge society, the second analyzes the MOOC training proposals, and the third discusses the future role of MOOCs.

abstract={Classification is used for discovery of a predictive learning function that classifies data item into one of several predefined classes. e.g., classify universities based on students number or based on offered programs, or classify cars based on gas mileage, and Presentation it by decision-tree, classification rule, neural network, and genetic algorithms, etc. It is noted that, there are large amount of data obtained from the universities. We need to evaluate the accurate assessment of the performance of any institution. Currently the decision in ministry of higher education and scientific research is taken randomly, not based on logical analysis. Moreover, the education towards to universal, the ministry of higher education in Yemen has to activate the council of accreditation, and support it to start quickly and effectively. In this paper, we have used approach to assist the council for accreditation to start automation for accreditation operations and mechanisms, that's proposed by using machine learning techniques, also to help decision makers for taking accurate and swift decisions. Our study is used to classify institution that wants to take a license from council to three classes: grant license of accreditation, grand license provided to improvement has done, or not granting accreditation license. We have used the intelligent algorithms for calculate probability of grand accreditation license based on degree of council standards, which we used to predict through a model building to classification by using Naïve Bayes algorithm. The proposed method is typically for evaluation the new institution by depends on evaluation of existing institutions. We experiment the proposed framework by flexible parameters and attributes with private training dataset, that's carefully generated and tested using real life applications. In addition, we implemented our proposed approach as a program.},

abstract={Educating users for effective disaster management skills can be a challenge that requires different levels of training support. While the training requirements can be different with respect to the contexts of managing different disaster types there can be generic training requirements that should be incorporated into all types of disaster management training. Another key aspect of disaster management training is to associate new tools and technologies that facilitate disaster management and relief work. Wireless sensor based disaster management is an emerging research area that promotes technology incorporation into different levels of disaster management tasks. In this work we explore the training for disaster management activities with wireless sensor networks. As the training platform we use a novel, yet increasingly popular and learner engaging, immersive environment OpenSim. In an OpenSim installation, a specialised training environment was developed to simulate several disaster scenarios and required wireless sensors. A set of users have successfully used the training environment and provided feedback. The next phase of the research is planned to produce a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) to facilitate academics and students for disaster management training.},

pages={268-274},
abstract={Building refers to a structure with enclosing elements such as Roof, Wall and Floor that is used for certain purpose and function. The basic function of a building is to provide shelter to its user and promotes comfort. Building Services plays a vital role in building design as it provides a controlled environment to the occupants in the building. A building with proper integration of building services has a structural soundness and which is related to the productivity of the user. In engineering education and architecture education, the building services subjects related to plumbing, water supply and sanitation, electrical services, fire safety etc. are taught in a theoretical approach. The theoretical approach of the building services subject for one semester gives limited knowledge about the building services and its application in building design, which finally results in poor performance of the building. The integration of the building services are also a difficult task to achieve with the theoretical exposure. The basic concepts are taught to the students in a theoretical approach using conventional teaching methods with chalk boards for teaching the basics and detailing through graphical representations, sketches etc. Then the students are requested to do case studies related to integration of building services in the building through industrial visits for better understanding of the basic concepts and detailing. There are various teaching models such as Black Box Approach, Glass Box Approach and Participatory Approach available in education of building design. These approaches require certain tools to execute the knowledge acquired in building services into the building design process. A study has been conducted to develop an effective teaching method to teach building services which enhances the capability of the students in better design and detailing of the various building services. The paper aims to explain the application of the participatory tools such as Full Scale Simulation Modeling and User Behavior Modeling for teaching building services through the Toilet Design in engineering and architecture education. This teaching method with full scale simulation tool can be considered as the alternative teaching methodology for the professionals in academics to teach building services and make better understanding of the knowledge of building services in the students.},

abstract={The Free Open Source Software is a growing concern for Massive Open Online Courses. The Spoken-Tutorial is a program for the literate people who belong to the Information system environment. Spoken Tutorials Organize workshops focusing on “MOOC”. The Massive Open Online Course is a response to the challenges faced by organizations in order to collect related information of several matters. Spoken-Tutorial is prepared from the term that “information is everywhere” as a social network, you are a clickware of this digital world. A world where internet is a medium to access mass information. So, MOOC is the one way of learning in this digital social network world. MOOC is a course-Open, Participatory, Distributed and Lifelong networked learning. It has facility of various courses, with start, end dates and participants. It's a way to connect and collaborate while developing digital skills an engage in a learning process. It is an EVENT around which people who care about a topic can gather and talk about it in a structured way. MOOC can promote the network learning for lifelong. People that have reputations for interesting skills and innovative thinking besides a topic, collaborate by opening an online course covering that topic. Anyone can join it. In a MOOC we can choose what we want to do, how we want to participate and we can decide if we have been successful, just like an existing atmosphere. Tutorials on almost all the Free open source are run by Spoken tutorials which is available on the internet and is provided by the team of spoken tutorial project. In this analysis we have mentioned all the steps of spoken tutorial courses and have took a survey from computer engineering students who are currently being taught Linux as their course laboratory and subject. This survey contained the questions related to the spoken tutorial for FOSS Linux and mode to organize the workshop.},

As it is eventually found that there is a huge gap between engineering education and industry application in terms of learning. Engineering education follows more conventional and traditional practice on the other hand industry is more practical oriented where in emphasis on hands on skill development is primarily focused. To bring the transformation in engineering education it is prudent to address the major problems such as research methodologies, tools and techniques, Design Thinking, project planning, skill development and many more for conceiving ideas and executing the ideas into the real world. For this a multidisciplinary skill development workshop has been organized to impart basic set of skills like Carpentry, Sheet metal work, Electrical , Rapid prototyping among the engineering aspirants at the beginning of their engineering education.},

abstract={Although the foundation for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) was laid down around 2008, it is in the recent years that there has been observed the stupendous rise of MOOCs. Currently there has been much debate regarding its pros and cons. While access to high speed internet connection, computer systems and possessing a decent knowledge of the language that the course is instructed in (usually English) may prove to be barriers in some countries, this digital education offering has undoubtedly provided a learning edge to students and others, who can overcome these hurdles, irrespective of their geographical location, financial condition and time constraints. The two MOOC providers: Coursera and edX, have emerged as the major MOOC services over the years due to their tie-ups with numerous prestigious universities, free courses, user-friendly interface, and strong business model. The learning is primarily through videos and the MOOCs learners spend significant time in viewing course videos. This paper is the first survey-based study of its kind, to the best of our knowledge, conducted to explore the learner's perspective on video-viewing features offered by these two MOOC providers The survey assesses video-viewing related features on Coursera and edX namely, subtitle captions/transcripts, in-video quizzes, video duration, quality and video speed varying feature as experienced by the student participants, who have participated in both edX-offered courses and Coursera-offered courses.},

abstract={Online education has become the first choice for millions of Internet users around the world to get access to knowledge and skills. Many studies aim to implement performance prediction to mark learners with high risk of poor performance in the early stage of a course. Among these researches, the employment of features concerned with learning behaviors combined with machine learning techniques proves effective to achieve decent prediction results. However, the experiments of most existing researches are based on one or two courses, making people wonder whether there is a universally applicable prediction model for multiple courses. In this paper, we investigate performance of different prediction models with the perspective of big data. We collect the background data from 28 representative courses in different subjects on a popular MOOC platform in China, and evaluate the effectiveness of the existing predict models on them. The results show that 1) Within the scope of one course, it is wise to combine different activities data for prediction, and XGBoost is most effective prediction methods in most cases;2) There does not exist a generally feasible prediction model that works for all courses.},

abstract={In order to achieve excellence, it is important for the educational institutions to assess the outcomes of their graduate programmes. In general, the graduate programme outcomes are assessed through direct (examinations, projects, assignments etc) and indirect (co-curricular, extra-curricular, surveys etc) methods. The results through direct assessment are followed up with several actions such as remedial classes, tutorials etc. Accomplishments in Co-curricular, extra-curricular activities and Feedback surveys from the students, recruiters and alumni are considered for the indirect assessment of Programme outcomes. To improve these indirect assessment methods, some institutions are getting feedback for few activities manually. With the increasing use of ICT in education and mobile learning, we decided to launch a new mobile and web based indirect assessment tool (IAT) for assisting the programme assessment committee in our department. This tool automates the process of recording student's surveys, efficiently analyzes the feedback data from number of perspectives and produces ready-to-use reports which help other wings of the department such as Industry interaction, Research, Student's activities and Faculty development to decide future targets and follow-up actions. This tool contains well structured questionnaires for obtaining feedback of students on the course they learn during mid of a semester and end of a semester. The tool also collects feedback from graduates, alumni and employers to ensure an all-rounded assessment. The proposed Indirect Assessment Tool (IAT) has been implemented using web technologies such as HTML, PHP, JSON and JS. The tool has been tested successfully and is involved in indirect assessments of our degree programme since 2015.},

abstract={The Indian state of Kerala has a high literacy rate and human development index compared to other states in India. But this has not extended to the tribal population of the state. Female tribal populations are particularly disadvantaged for a variety of reasons including vulnerability to exploitation and abuse. This study investigates factors contributing to the high dropout rate and evaluates the success of a computer literacy intervention with tribal girls who had previously dropped out of the education system. A sample of 31 students in two centers was administered a survey to identify why the girls had dropped out of the school system. The analysis showed three clusters of learners. The students received computer literacy training after which they took an externally certified examination in basic Digital Literacy and computer concepts. Policy recommendations to decrease the dropout rate, ensure safety, and encourage further education for tribal girls are presented.},

abstract={An entrant to engineering has to undergo many fundamental courses in the first year of curriculum. Basic Electrical Engineering is one amongst these courses. The traditional way of teaching the course was teacher-centric and aid used for teaching was chalk and talk. Less emphasis was given for student interaction. Traditional style of teaching rarely gives students the opportunity to apply their newfound knowledge to actual situations, resulting in a serious time lag between students learning and applying new knowledge. As a result many students have trouble determining the relevance of what they are being taught, and thus lacking any obvious need to learn and fail to engage in the learning process. In teaching learning process, learning style of an individual is important to undergo different learning cycle. The three main types of learning styles are, auditory, visual, and tactile. With the help of a tool students learning style was identified through a set of questionnaires which helped to design an activity depending upon the learning styles of a student. From the survey it has been identified the majority of the class are visual learners which helped in designing an activity. The proposed model is applied to the course on Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering. Apart from the regular classroom teaching, principles of instruction was used to select, plan and develop an activity based on Industry visit to enhance students learning. To realize the impact of learning happened through the industry visit pertaining to topic on actuators the written examination was conducted and feedback at two intervals, before and after the industry visit was taken. Individual question wise inferential statistical analysis using paired t-test was performed and inferred that the activity improved the knowledge and exposure level of a student with different learning style. From the activity it is also inferred that though a small percentage of students are auditory learners, visual learning has helped the student to enhance the conceptual learning through visualization.},

abstract={Plagiarism refers to the stealing of intellectual property-ideas, words, thoughts, conclusions, without giving proper credit to the author Young students and novice researchers lack the skills to identify and avoid plagiarism and thus end up in committing it. Anything available through the digital world and Internet is considered to be free of any legal or intellectual property issues by some writers and researchers, thus leading to the immense growth of plagiarism. Though digitization has led to an increase in plagiarism of contents, it has also led to the development of plagiarism detection tools that are used to combat it. Plagiarism has been rising at steadfast rate due to a number of factors, the major ones being lack of awareness and fierce competition to excel. This paper highlights the various aspects of plagiarism and the various steps being taken by the Indian government to curb this menace. We have also discussed survey results and conclusions based on the seminars conducted to make students aware about plagiarism, its consequences (through the case studies) and the means to curb it. The paper also highlights the various challenges that we are currently facing in combating plagiarism and some potential areas that researchers can look forward to.},

abstract={Owing to the large number of students that academic institutions have to accommodate, automated evaluation of students' programs has received impetus in recent years; an automated evaluator not only ensures speedy evaluation but also consistency in distribution of marks. A construct that appears frequently in programs is the else-if block. The condition that appears in a subsequent else-if block should not be weaker (i.e., less general) than any of its preceding conditions, otherwise this block will never be executed (in other words, this block qualifies as dead code). Such wrong ordering of conditions in else-if blocks are often introduced by novice student programmers. It is to be noted that such violation of precedence of conditions in else-if constructs qualifies as logical error which is not detected by standard compilers, such as gcc. In this work, we tabulate different cases to identify the correct and the incorrect precedence of conditions in else-if constructs and thereby, automatically report such errors in students' programs and also provide feedback towards error correction.},

abstract={Today's world lays more emphasis on embedded product design which necessitates the inclusion of hardware courses like Digital Electronics, Computer Organization and Microcontrollers in the curriculum for undergraduate program in Computer Science. These pre-requisite courses introduced in the lower semesters pave the way for students to develop keen interest, skill and proficiency in the area of Embedded system design. But students of Computer Science generally lack interest in hardware related courses, a fact which has been observed time and again by teachers handling these courses. Therefore the challenges that lay before the course instructors was to make the students take interest in these courses and also to make them industry ready so as to compete with peers from other engineering branches in the domain of Embedded Systems. This paper discusses the experience of the authors in teaching the course on Digital Electronics laboratory. In order to handle the challenges mentioned above, after much debate and discussion, amongst all stake holders, it was decided to apply structured enquiry based learning strategy. Structured enquiry is a form of pedagogical practice that facilitates students' to build on previous learning and provide a strong foundation for further learning in relation to the objectives defined. This approach was also found to enhance the quality of teaching as a result of which students' ability to conduct investigations of technical issues consistent with their level of knowledge and understanding improved. Here we present a set of activities, their related outcome based assessment techniques and outcome based strategies applied to the laboratory course on Digital Electronics in Computer Engineering at the III Semester level. The course was designed to consist of initially, conducting simple exercises to provide hands on experience and use of appropriate modern engineering tools to simulate the designed circuit for the given problem statement after which it was prototyped. Along with the regular lab experiments, student' teams were made to work on course projects which required them to design and build projects. This promoted their self-learning, improved their knowledge of digital circuit design well beyond that directly taught in lectures, improved students' creative thinking, applied logic ability and practical thinking. This paper discusses the attempts made by the course teachers to achieve these goals. The first step was to set appropriate course outcomes (COs). The subsequent step was to align the COs to suitable Program Outcomes (POs) through relevant competencies (CAs) and performance indicators (PIs). Later rubrics were written to assess the attainment of each of the Program Outcomes. This activity resulted in enhanced motivational levels amongst students, increased their involvement in the team and improved their knowledge due to self learning.},

abstract={During the last decades, our society is witnessing an authentic revolution that, in a dizzying manner has deeply influenced, modified, and transformed the way of life of human beings. This constant and unstoppable revolution is transmuting all areas of our life: social, cultural, personal, labor, economic, training, etc. This new society is characterized by a high generation of knowledge and the constant and fluid processing of information. In this macro-context, the MOOC phenomenon emerged. MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) courses are based on the principles of massive, free access to all materials and resources offered online. This new didactic path can be constituted in an innovative techno-social tendency, especially oriented in the panorama of Higher Education to stimulate university improvement, open opportunities at the same time for education and training or, simply, derive towards a new business model for the universities. In addition to being an entry point for the popularization of science and knowledge, the future possibilities are enormous and are being studied in all their various dimensions. Many initiatives as a result have been developed to implement this new form of education. MOOC Courses and the Future of Higher Education presents the latest research theories and current examples of MOOC courses practices in Higher Education. The chapters represent an extensive assortment of interpretations and practices examples of MOOC courses, across areas as varied as teaching methodologies, instructional innovations, educational technology, etc. This work is structured in three sections, the first one covers the university institution in the knowledge society, the second analyzes the MOOC training proposals, and the third discusses the future role of MOOCs.

abstract={Video Lecture Capturing (VLC) has become an increasingly important part of the e-learning content portfolio. These are widely used video resources for e-learning and preparing students for a virtual classroom set-up and these are the most commonly used technology as a teaching and learning tool. In this study the researchers sought to solve an observed problem of high failure rates in technical modules in the department of Information Technology by investigating the feasibility of using VLC as a teaching and learning tool in a rural university in South Africa. The researchers investigated the perceived attitude of students towards VLC by implementing VLC in an experiment set-up and allowing students to reflect on their usage experience. The results indicated that the VLC can be a useful teaching and learning tool for student performance improvement though they may be hampered by the unavailability of resources and poor IT infrastructure which could drive down adoption of VLC and by extension affect the pioneering of other e-learning technologies. The researchers propose a substantial investment be made in VLC systems in order for the students to enjoy the envisaged benefit of their usage.},

It is extremely hard for any programming elective subject to attain the course outcomes because of huge variation in the students background, constraints of allotting less number of credits and traditional classroom teaching. The solution to this dilemma is provided by hands on session tutorials that transforms and enhances traditional classroom teaching. We proposed, refined the curriculum, and tested for teaching first elective course in programming languages. In this paper we present the effectiveness of teaching programming elective subject by introducing ”Hands on Sessions” and redesigning our curriculum to meet stakeholders requirements. Our results presented in this paper indicate that incorporating ”Hands on Sessions” in teaching programming elective subject is an effective tool to attain the learning outcomes of the course. In addition, new teaching methodology enhances the students problem solving skills and improves self learning ability.},

abstract={Undergraduate (UG) Research is the first step in a students' life to taste the experience of a research work. It is also a unique experience for the teachers to guide the students in research work during their UG study. In this paper we want to share our research experience through the project that involves the building of a Robotic arm which mimics the motion of the human arm of the user at Humanitarian Technology (HuT) Labs of Amrita. The system monitors the motion of the user's arm using a Kinect. The skeletal image of the arm obtained using the “Kinect Skeletal Image” project of Kinect SDK, consists of 3 joints and links connecting them. Coordinate Geometry is used to calculate the angles between the links connecting the joints. This gives us the angles for a 3D representation of the human arm. The angles thus obtained are sent using a serial communication port to the Arduino microcontroller, which in turn generates signals which are sent to the servo motors. The servo motors rotate according the angles given as input. The combined motion of the servos results in a complete Robotic arm movement which is a mimic of the human arm movement.},

abstract={The role of ABET accreditation system is quite significant in providing guidance towards program and course design. The program outcomes encompassing through knowledge, skill and attitude play an important role towards competency development of the students. To improve the employability quotient of these fresh graduates, the alignment of respective outcomes along with the base lined expectations of IT industry is needed. In this context Software Engineering (SE) plays an important role in the transformation journey of the graduates to become entry level developers. It also helps to bridge the gap between academia and IT industry so that these new hires are productive as soon as possible. In this paper, the expectations of an IT industry from the new hires is described in conjunction with ABET educational outcomes highlighting pedagogical aspects that enable students develop these abilities. SE course is used as vehicle and an approach is presented integrating software code of ethics (recommended by ACM - IEEE), SE principles, pedagogical aspects and assessment instruments. Subsequently experiences from our corporate learning environment are highlighted.},

abstract={This paper addresses p-processes single processor scheduling problem with a common deadline, to minimize the total execution time and reduce the penalty costs. Process scheduling is one of the most essential factor on which the efficiency and the performance of the work done by the CPU depends. Earliness and tardiness of the processes degrades the efficiency of the processor as they carry penalty costs with them. Thus, the scheduling problem of minimizing the total sum of earliness and tardiness with a common deadline on a single processor is important and competitive. Scheduling is particularly one of the subset of combinatorial optimization problems, which are in fact NP-Hard problems. This problem can be solved using heuristic and meta-heuristic approach such as genetic algorithm for optimal results. In the experiment performed, the Genetic Algorithm outperforms the results in comparison with a simple heuristic method.},

abstract={In today's era, graduates need to acquire the competent skill sets to get a good job. The traditional education model suffers from the limitations of assessing these skills. Outcome Based Education (OBE) model plays an important role in this context by overcoming the above-specified issue. OBE empirically measures the student performance and helps to demonstrate the skills that are clearly articulated to them at the start of the program. Accrediting bodies are focusing more on the assessment of student learning outcomes. Every year huge datasets of assessment data are accumulated using OBE model. If analyzed properly, this data can be used to predict student competencies. Manual record keeping and attainment calculation make it a challenging task to extract meaningful information from this ever-growing data repository. The proposed work implicates the construction of a framework to automate the attainment process using the assessment and mapping data of Program Outcomes and Course Outcomes retrieved from an indirect assessment tool. The attainment data so obtained is used to predict attainment of various programs and courses using the classification techniques. The work done helps the instructors to find meaningful information from assessment data and helps them to take proactive decisions to improve the attainment of low-performing courses. Moreover, with automation of attainment calculation, manual work for the faculty is reduced, resulting in time-saving and better focusing on attainment improvement and various other scholarly activities.},

The results are based on a study of 6,000+ participants of a set of IT, business, and Design Thinking MOOCs to determine success in gender homogenous and heterogeneous virtual team tasks. The study uses observational data to track individual performance, based on gender, in online courses. Even though men were over represented, individual female performance in team assignments is shown to be significantly better than male performance. The results speak for successful teamwork in online courses on the one hand and open up further opportunities for good performance of women in STEM disciplines on the other hand.},

abstract={There has been a dramatic expansion in both the amount of available large-scale educational databases and educational mining techniques. Educational data mining has been a fertile subject of research in recent times; further, the use of educational data mining has become popular among both researchers and practitioners. Log files generated by computer-based learning environments like Intelligent Tutoring Systems contain a wealth of information about learner behaviors that characterize academic success. There is growing interest in mining these data sources for knowledge-based discovery to reveal relevant, meaningful, and useful educational information to illuminate our understanding of learners' behaviors and outcomes. All too often however, extracting the pertinent information from the data to leverage the data mining techniques can be a major roadblock; for example, the asynchronous nature of the data logged in computer-based learning environments and data mining tools pose several challenges for mining data. We sought to mitigate this by developing a parser for the BioWorld System. In this paper, we explore the viability of a hand-coded parser by presenting BioWorldParser (a suite of scripts), which was developed to parse and retrieve data from raw log files generated by the BioWorld system, to help leverage educational data mining techniques in the context of an Intelligent Tutoring System for the medical domain.},

abstract={Self-directed learning is a potential methodology recommended in medical education to promote life-long learning. To promote self-directed learning skills and to make students life-long learners, self-directed learning sessions were conducted at Melaka Manipal Medical College (Manipal Campus), Manipal University, India. Students' knowledge in the topics was assessed in three formative assessments conducted during the course. This study was conducted to explore whether there is any change in students' readiness for self-directed learning as they experience the curriculum, and also to find out whether the change is reflected in students' academic performance in topics learnt through self-directed learning. To assess the change in self-directed learning readiness, self-directed learning readiness scale was administered to the students at the commencement and at the end of first year of the MBBS course. Students' scores in all three formative assessments were also collected. There was a statistically significant increase in self-directed learning readiness of students at the end of year compared to the commencement. Students' scores significantly increased in second and third when compared to first formative assessment. A weak positive correlation between the assessment scores was observed. The study demonstrated that students' readiness for self-directed learning was increased as they experienced the curriculum which was reflected in their academic performance.},

Computer based simulation software's are used to teach different aspects of power system by most of the Institutions. These simulation studies often do not demonstrate the physical sense of power system behavior to students. Moreover, making the students to visualize the effect of instability is a very big challenge faced by the teaching community. This paper describes the experimental set up built in the Electrical Engineering Department of Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore, consisting of an alternator connected to infinite bus through parallel transmission lines. In this experimental setup, the generator is brought to instability by changing the operating conditions. Further, the oscillation is controlled and brought back to stability by controlling the excitation and line reactance. This gives the clear idea about stability and its enhancement to the students.},

abstract={Comprehensive curriculum is essential for overalldevelopment of professionals. Like other countries, in Indiatoo the engineering educators have a task of insistingattainment of graduate attributes to suit the global needs. Teaching engineering courses help us to attain the programoutcomes [1]. However, real challenge lies in efficientattainment of ethical principles and effective functioning ofprofessionals as a member in diverse team by effectivecommunication. Thus proper guiding and assessing practical engineering skills is the need of the hour. We focus on educative growth of ethical and communicative skills attained in the present study wherecapstone project is taken as an example. The project issubdivided into two level first the pre-project and the finalproject. Capstone project is an amalgamation of all the basiclearning and the application component of the curriculum. In order to evaluate the attainment of ethical skill andcommunicative skill, the assessment rubrics need to bedesigned well. This work discusses the manner which canmeasure the attribute attainment quite precisely. After acquiring fundamental knowledge on engineering subjects, the students are made to work on acapstone project. Attainment of the program outcome (PO)is quantified with a class with seventy students. The finalyear under-graduate students are divided into group of fourto the maximum. A topic and a faculty adviser ofcorresponding specialization is assigned to each of thegroups. Rubrics of formative assessment are attentivelychosen to incorporate the attributes of ethics and soft skills. Bimonthly evaluations were graded by the guide anddepartmental faculty other than the guide. The summativeassessment is done along with an external examiner from the neighboring institution. Mode of attainment of courseoutcome (CO) to PO has been discussed in the full paperalong with the state diagram of the evaluation process. Asthe students go ahead with execution of the project throughregular meetings with guide, the communication is assessedby rubrics which emphasize the report writing skilldevelopment. The written communication skill is thensubsequently corroborated by oral presentation. Thepresentation is evaluated again to judge the oralcommunication skill as a part of a team of maximum fourmembers with varied aptitudes. Another important point isin the rubrics we have introduced plagiarism check to ensure the ethical attribute of the graduate. By keeping a threshold value for acceptance limit of plagiarism one can evaluate the skill of written communication and originality of thoughts. The attainment of CO to PO is graded from theformative assessment score in pre-project work and finalproject work. In order to take in-depth evaluation, we havetaken 75% of the total marks as the criteria for assessing aparticular skill of a student. Capstone project is consideredas culmination of all the teaching-learning in the curriculumfor the discipline. After framing the rubics and mapping ofthe particular Course Outcome to Program Outcome, logichas been exercised selectively to map with either strong ormoderate attainment of the latter. The process and it's prosand cons will be discussed in detials in full paper.},

abstract={In India, a large percentage of graduating engineers are not industry ready. The primary reason is that the colleges have outdated syllabi leading to a wide gap between the curriculum and the requirements of industry. Students who take up internships are very few among Tier-2 and Tier-3 colleges. All these problems result in graduates who are unemployable without training in basic skills by the industry. An internship could help the students in overcoming many of these shortcomings as they learn about corporate industries and receive basic training. This paper presents a novel initiative towards this end by the IEEE Student Branch, College of Engineering, Chengannur. It aims at spreading awareness about the advantages of taking up internship opportunities, providing the basic training and helping students get internships. The program was a huge success and helped a large number of students in securing internship offers. This model, if replicated in other colleges could significantly improve the employability of students and help them improve their academic performance and engineering skill sets.},

abstract={Higher education or lack of higher education effects many socioeconomic characteristics such as employment, income and social mobility. Increasing access and removing barriers to higher education is a key factor in allowing people from different socioeconomic backgrounds, to make significant change in their own lives.The psychometric test - the screening and entry test used by higher education institute in Israel (the equivalent of the US SATs) is one of the barriers standing between young people in Israel and higher education.Many factors contribute to the ability of an individual to pass this test, some of have nothing to do with ability or motivation. Factors regarding an individual's socioeconomic background affect the outcome of the test, and therefore the access to higher education.While 72% of all individuals how finished high school, belonging to the highest socioeconomic group in Israel, take the test, only 21% of the lowest socioeconomic group do so. The average gap between individuals from the highest and the lowest socioeconomic background is an unimaginable gap of 200 points (out of a possible score of 800 points). This figure means the difference between higher education and no higher education, and everything that stems from it.An industry of about 80,000,000$ (more than 250,000,000 ILS) a year has grown over the years, around preparation courses for the test, with an average coast of 2,500$ (8,000 ILS) per course, giving an unfair advantage to whomever can afford it - the already privileged groups of society.The Ministry of Social Equality in Israel has launched a free massive open online course designed to help university applicants prepare for the psychometric test. With a foreseen Return on Investment of over 605,000,000 ILS in the next 15 years, the course is designed to remove or at least lower one of the barriers to higher education, and promote equal opportunity.This article will elaborate on the reasons behind the decision to create a free open digital course by the government, designed to help learners prepare for the psychometric test. It will touch on the outcomes of the first course runs, and the ways in which the Ministry of Social Equality plans to reach relevant publics and mitigate the course to those publics with little to no experience with digital learning, language barriers, low digital literacy, and low self-efficacy.},

abstract={In the last decade, the world of online education has seen the advent of Massive Open Online Courses. The secret behind those courses lies in the scale: potentially, millions of people can access them and take advantage of the educational resources wherever they are on the planet. Creating successful courses is challenging since it requires an extended portfolio of skills. However, not all the necessary attentions have been provided to the content creators who, most of the times, do not have an extended knowledge of the complex technologies required in order to efficiently prepare a MOOC. This paper focuses on this issue introducing a set of integrated e-learning tools offering an enhanced MOOC creation experience. The preliminary users already prepared some courses exploiting this novel approach and are willing to collaborate to craft the next improved version of the platform.},

pages={452-456},
abstract={When optical fibers are dealing with small power then the state of fiber is known as linear and when there is increase in power then the optical fiber is prone to non-linear effects. Self-Phase Modulation (SPM), Cross Phase Modulation (XPM), Four Wave Mixing (FWM), Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS), Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) are one of the common non-linearities in fibers. This paper focuses on the relationship between frequency and quality factor with enhanced bit rate and optimized power with adequate frequency levels, compensation is done by using three methods pre, post and symmetric compensation but post-compensation method is used in this paper while evaluating the results for better performance and high efficiency. The performance characteristics like that of maximum quality factor and minimum bit error rate yields different results with change in laser frequency, but appropriate results have been discussed for proper implementation.},

abstract={With the development of latest technologies and their usage become wide spread in all areas of the world. Moreover, using large amounts of data and also their applications are sophisticated and thus the technologies lead to consume huge amounts of energy, latency, bandwidth and also throughput. In the case of client server communication, the client is completely depending on their server at computation logic; meanwhile, the application logic is only performed at the client. When the age of thin clients becomes popular in developing countries with the profits of security, reliability, less vulnerability, maintainability and sustainability have been moved to the usefulness of their inevitable good behaviors. Interactive applications can be caused some bottlenecks of performance delay over thin client server network. The safest technique to access the smooth performance is the explanation and reintroduction of overclocking method which can be used efficiently for the system under some special considerations which was not warranted by manufacturer's rating. As overclocking is not a new method, many researchers have been used it in a variety of application fields and mixed with other resource demand machine learning methods. This paper figures out that thin clients are used with Remote Desktop Protocols connection and the rendering of interactive applications (only used Benchmark apps) on them successfully accomplished by overclocking method.},

In general scripting languages are easier to learn and faster to code than structured and compiled languages such as C and C++. Scripting languages have many important advantages over traditional programming languages. In future the usage of these languages is likely to increase. In this paper we discuss and report our experience in teaching scripting languages lab at the undergraduate level, 4th semester. Scripting language is an umbrella term used for languages like unix shell, TCL, perl, java, python and LISP. Out of these, we have chosen UNIX shell programming and python for our curriculum. The authors report various pedagogical activities like multiple assignments, peer assessment within a group, self learning through e-resources and course project that were employed during the course. The course projects were specially designed so as to make students explore the vast number of python packages. The authors found that these activities definitely enhance the learning experience and there was a remarkable change in the learning level of the students as compared to previous years as evident in the grades obtained by the students.},

We linger on SWAYAM's most distinctive feature: its credit system, that allows higher education institutions to integrate MOOCs into their offering. We also present some of the early achievements of the platform: In December 2018, the first SWAYAM examination was conducted, with about 16% of India's public higher education institutions allowing their students to earn academic credit through MOOCs taken on SWAYAM [2, 3]. In the second SWAYAM examination, conducted in May 2019, that number grew to 21% [2, 4].},

The perception of any software is driven entirely by its User Interface (UI). Usable software sells better and unusable software is abandoned. Designing usable UIs is challenging and instilling such designing skills in students is even more challenging. This paper investigates Experiential Learning methodology used to imbibe UI Designing Skills in students through the course "Principles of User Interface Design". The primary objective was to attain Graduate Attributes/Program Outcomes (POs) 1, 2 and 3 as defined in the Outcome Based Education (OBE). The approach comprised of two main activities – Identifying Good UIs and Bad UIs and Designing UI Prototypes. A rubric based assessment was used to test the concepts' realization among students. This novel approach did not claim to have given students deeper knowledge in UI designing. Nevertheless, it did aim for a useful foundation. The approach can be adopted in designing good UIs in mini projects and capstone projects.},

The results obtained for the first study indicates that there exists moderately strong relationship. The second study shows that correlation coefficients of related courses are better while that of some unrelated courses have moderate value. This means that in case of related courses the skills acquired in a prerequisite course can help them to do better in the current course. This exploratory analysis when properly interpreted can help plan and retrospect and re-adjust the mode of assessment or course delivery to enhance student learning.},

abstract={In support of the mission to ‘increase interest, enjoyment, confidence, and ability in mathematics and computer science among learners and educators in Canada and internationally’, the University of Waterloo’s Centre for Education in Mathematics and Computing (CEMC), working in collaboration with local education technology provider DigitalEd, made its mathematics content globally accessible to serve as an online complement to mathematics educators, in addition to providing a source of online resources for independent study and upskilling of non-registered learnersIn September 2019, the full library of resources was launched and promoted globally, grouped into courses based on the topics covered in the Canadian curriculum for grades 7 to 12, along with special topics in financial literacy. As of April 2020, the resources had been accessed by over 250,000 users across 213 countries, with over 1.7M exercises attempted. Peak usage saw over 300,000 pageviews in a day, reaching over 40,000 unique users across 86 countries, with over 99.9% uptime, utilizing dynamically scaled cloud instances to handle unexpected loads. Continuous system monitoring was employed as a supplement to automated alerts and reliability engineering tools in order to maintain system performance and uptimeThis paper provides an overview of the considerations and principles followed in the planning and design of mathematics learning resources, structured as year-long courses in secondary school mathematics, and provides a summary of the requirements for the infrastructure put in place to enable continuous, scalable, global open access. It concludes with an overview of recommendations for localization as a means to increase adoption in regions where English is not the primary educational language.},

abstract={Outcome based education (OBE) is the modern teaching buzzword which is widely accepted and practiced in most of the educational institutes across the world. For engineering courses where understanding of technical concept with practical understanding is highly relevant, the modern tool usage as project based learning during the delivery of course is required. This paper presents an innovative approach to evaluate the course outcomes (CO's) of the course power quality and its relationship with program outcomes (PO's) of Electrical Engineering. The evaluation is done by taking components from continuous internal assessment, modern tool usage, assignments and attendance. The course outcomes of different subjects are then mapped with program outcomes as one of the tool.},

The MOOC instruction team trialed an intervention based on tough love to guide students to engage with these resources and learn how to learn on their own. By setting expectations, simplifying help resources and carefully delaying responses to queries for help, the team nudged students toward active, independent and social learning. The tough love approach guided students to practice a skill needed for future success and provided the instruction team members with a new perspective on their roles in teaching and learning.},

Such innovative use of video-based learning has attracted attention from researchers and practitioners in the education field. Therefore, we conducted questionnaire surveys to obtain student learning motivations and learning styles during such a course. The purpose of this study is to propose a method that can use questionnaire results and predefined group types to classify students in the early stages of a class. We found a link between learning motivation and learning behavior. As the class progressed, we executed a daily clustering system. The questionnaire results provided only a preliminary reference which forms the basis for student grouping. With a greater sample, we could also better optimize the definition of groups and add new groups.},

abstract={One of the original purposes of MOOCs is to democratize education worldwide in order to advance towards a fairer society and universal human development. However, initial findings suggest that there are a number of challenges that MOOCs face to achieve their maximum potential in developing countries and regions with complex issues of access to high quality education. The majority of research studies on MOOCs focus on one or a small number of courses, or an overview of an entire platform or system, such as edX or FutureLearn. However, these kinds of investigations can mask important regional variation in different parts of the world. In this study we conduct a longitudinal analysis using data from six years of courses from MITx and HarvardX, focusing on the particular Arab world sub-population, and comparing to the rest of the world and also on their human development index. A close investigation of this subpopulation will help us better understand what kinds of course registration and course-taking patterns are influenced by regional cultural factors, and what dimensions of MOOC learning are more universal. In this work we present initial results after conducting exploratory analysis on 452 MOOCs (~4.5M unique learners) from MITx and HarvardX, which show that despite the important cultural and geographical contrasts, the general trends are quite similar. Still, we observe some significant differences, such as lower completion metrics for Arabic countries when performing this comparison within each human development category and also some differences in percentage of enrolments per course category.},

The key focus of integrated learning was attainment of focused outcomes b, c, g and k (ABET criteria).We are elated that we attained outcome i as a bonus, although it was not focused. In this paper, we show that integrated learning framework led to attainment of focused outcomes, improved skills in students such as presentation skills, teamwork skills, and problem solving skills. This also led to performance improvement in examination and increased student's confidence level. This makes students to stand out in crowd and acquire an edge in competition.},

The value obtained out of these tools are then transformed to a score and checked whether they meet the required attainment level of Course Outcome set for a particular Course. The scores of all the Course Outcomes collectively contribute towards the attainment of Programme Outcome. This process is recursively applied for four years until the student completes the Programme. This paper presents a direct assessment method used in measuring the Programme Outcomes (POs) via appropriate direct assessment tools.

The science of psychology can answer all these questions. But surprisingly, we are never taught psychology as a mandatory science. The World Health Organization has defined health as "a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity". Today's curriculum gives more stress on physical well-being and, contrastingly, very less stress on mental well-being.

The paper discusses an open source graphical programming tool built on Minibloq platform that allows students to focus more on creative part of programming. The paper proposes a graphical approach to programming where a student need not remember any constructs of a programming language, but relies on the approach to solve a problem. The programming utility is developed for an open source Arduino platform. Currently the tool is developed to control a real robot built around Arduino platform. Thus a platform to learn fundamentals of programming as well as robotics is made available to students. The graphical programming tool with the robotic hardware was found to be easy to learn by high school students during an outreach program conducted by the authors. The framework is also extendable beyond programming and can be further developed to understand robotics.},

abstract={Computer systems play an integral role in all facets of the engineering profession. Systems users are always in need of faster, more powerful, yet cheaper computer systems. This calls for an understanding of the processor-level components of computer systems, their design and operation, and their impact on the overall performance of the systems. To fulfill this requirement the course on Computer System Design and Architecture has been introduced in the 3rd semester. Earlier, there were two courses offered with titles “Computer Organization” in Semester 3 and “Advanced Computer Architecture” in Semester 8. These two courses were not related and there existed a gap of 4 semesters in learning of these two courses. Students were unable to appreciate the architecture related concepts in other courses of lower semesters. As mentioned in IEEE SWEEBOK curriculum recommendations, a wide semantic gap exists between the computer's intended behavior and the workings of the underlying electronic devices that actually do the work within the computer. This gap is bridged through Computer Organization. On the other hand Computer Architecture is the course that specifies the relations and parts of a computer system and it deals with mainly three elements viz. Instruction Set Architecture, Computer Organization and Hardware. Accordingly, a course on Computer System Design and Architecture which combines the study of Computer Organization and Computer Architecture is designed to be offered at semester 3. The next challenge came in the form of delivery of the course. Since a detailed conceptual understanding of computer organization and architecture is required, which was not possible only with classroom delivery, self study activity was introduced which provided ability to the students to compare various processor architectures, their functionality and visibility to information processing. This continuous process helped them acquire knowledge, values, skills and understanding that they will require throughout their lifetime.},

One of the biggest limitations/ challenges in MOOC today is conducting effective assessments in a large-scale environment. The quality of large-scale assessment is under threat from multiple sources including assessment instrument specific and measurement errors. Assessment instrument specific errors are related to the extent to which assessments meet its objectives while measurement errors are incurred during the process of evaluation. A survey of sample of existing assessment instruments used for large scale assessments is conducted to identify assessment instrument specific errors. In this paper, we have proposed the usage of technology to build electronic item banks for avoiding assessment instrument specific and measurement errors, thereby improving the quality of assessments. We have proposed 12 unique item types which are amenable for automatic evaluation. The process of evaluating students response automatically is discussed in detail for each item type. These automated item types provides cost effective ways for achieving validity and reliability for large scale assessments.},

abstract={Common perception of students towards Technical education is highly paid jobs; relatively very few of them are inclined due to interest, passion, and self motivation. With wide and varied range of interest groups in technical student community, Current Technical education model is preparing technocrats to serve better in the industry. But in practice - it is not so, very recently IT companies have increased duration of training sessions of these selected candidates before actually assigning them on real projects. This surely focuses on the gap of technocrats passing out every year and the level of skilled candidates required by Industries. This paper proposes Development & Innovation Model to improve the employability in Industries. This model will incorporate dynamic nature of IT and other technological development in allied areas without adding too much cost to existing setup and holding cost. The DC-model discussed in this paper incorporates recent learning system evolved like MOOCs and Online platform together with state of art approaches of learning to Chase the current technical demands of the industries from the employees and learner platforms. This paper also throws light on various challenges and opportunity and limitations observed during the implementation of DC-Model towards adoptability by every Technical Institution to satisfy future demands and improve the quality of education rather than quantity.},

abstract={Increasingly, older models of MOOCs as standalone courses are giving way to multi-course series, up to and including online degrees. Between a single course and a full degree, all the major MOOC providers have created at least one multi-course “microcredential”. This descriptive paper maps the microcredentials that currently exist, using data gathered from the MOOC platforms (e.g. Coursera, edX, Udacity, FutureLearn, and others). Data include price, length of program, availability of academic credit, and level of effort per week on over 450 unique microcredentials. This paper uses a two-step cluster analysis to group miocrocredentials across type, using factors including price, duration, and weekly effort. Grouping microcredentials across MOOC platforms is a first step to understanding what place these credentials might occupy in the overall landscape of higher education.},

Except for a few research and management institutions, by and large the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) did not appear in the global rankings, this non- appearance is a reflection of a policy neglect on higher education system in the country, leading to only a few institutions finding their places in the world rankings conducted by different bodies. The policy response to address this problem was that India having National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) to rank HEIs. The two year old NIRF has to be made robust enough for it to become relevance in improving the quality of education system. To this end research paper systematically engages in content and discourse analysis of NIRFs methodology, to identify its gaps and make a policy recommendation for developing it into a robust framework.},

abstract={Outcome based education (OBE) has been adapted in major education institutions particularly in engineering education. This has been used extensively since the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) has made it mandatory for program accreditation. The OBE focusses on outcomes of the program rather than curriculum framed for the courses. Outcomes may refer to the knowledge or Skill gained, competency and employability of the graduates of the program. In order to achieve this outcome, the syllabus has to be carefully and meticulously planned with scope for continuous improvement. In the Department of Electronics and Communication, BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore, We have adopted the OBE system. This paper aims to provide the evaluation process in our department to measure the outcomes. For each course, the course outcomes (COs) are methodically articulated keeping the focus on Program outcomes (POs) that are defined by the NBA.},

abstract={It is well established that learners have different learning preferences. There are multiple ways of characterising learners based on their learning preferences available in the literature. Even though there are efforts to design pedagogic practices considering the learning preferences of learners, it still demands further investigation. Further, what factors influence learning preferences of learners is also an interesting dimension of research. This paper discusses about our observations over changing learning preferences of learners over a period of time and investigating the influence of factors like gender, urban / rural divide and medium of instruction on learning style preferences of learners. This study is desirable as it will help design content as well pedagogy respecting the learning preferences. Learning style preferences of students of undergraduate engineering degree programs are used for the purpose of this study. Though there are different learning style assessment methods / tools available in the literature, because of availability of software tool and the familiarity of authors with the tool, Questionnaire from Index of Learning styles (ILS) by Richard M. Felder and Silverman is used in the study. It is evident from the results that learners' preferences are changing from verbal to visual, reflective to active, sequential to global and sensory to intitutive. The results of the study are presented in the paper and discussed.},

This is achieved through an initial attempt to understand the usage of the tool, apply it to comprehend concepts in suitable courses, and finally use the tool to apply, formulate, design, implement and demonstrate a self-designed task, also known as the ‘Open-ended’ experiment. The proposed method of introducing the modern tool can be included in any semester, and when implemented in most semesters, leads to an overall development of the graduate with necessary attributes, as the proposed method includes an attempt to relate various courses in the program.

abstract={Graph theory has been demonstrated by many researchers to be useful during the conceptual phase of mechanism design. In this regard it has been put to use by many works for systematically synthesizing varieties of epicyclic gear trains (EGTs) of one degree of freedom. This paper makes use of the solutions derived using graph theory and introduces a procedure for identifying the constituent links corresponding to the chosen EGT graph concept so that it can be realized into a 3-D CAD model. It is seen that certain EGT graphs do not lead to meaningful 3-D representation. Conditions for a graph to result in a meaningful EGT structure are also derived in the process.},

abstract={Emerging load demand cannot be fulfilled by the output of one generator. Therefore two or more generators should be synchronized in order to share the load. The synchronizing variables of voltage magnitudes, frequency of the voltages, phase angle difference between the voltages and the phase sequence of the voltages should be considered. Synchronizers are widely employed in the industry. University students learn the theories of synchronization. Most of the laboratories in universities do not have practical modules or laboratory equipment to demonstrate the synchronization process. Traditional synchronization systems are not suitable for the visualization of generator synchronization. “A Practical Module for Generator Synchronization System” is designed to overcome the problem of understanding synchronization process. This system is useful for the students in understanding the synchronization process along with the real time simulation of the synchronization. The system will demonstrate the synchronization process of two generator outputs either manually or automatically. It will also synchronize two generators. The system consists of voltmeters to give the voltage of generator output, frequency meters to give the frequencies of voltages, bulb system to indicate phase sequence, a synchroscope and a phase meter to indicate the pulse width variation of two voltage outputs. The system is prepared for the laboratory equipment and tested under the laboratory conditions. This paper presents how the separate sections of A Practical Module for Generator Synchronization System were developed and its results.},

abstract={The penetration of Information Technology (IT) in every field of business has opened up a plethora of employment opportunities at the global level. India has become a global hub for IT services export, where industry has felt a pressing need for acquiring and retaining competent talent. However, there is a strong feeling in the industry circles that students graduating from engineering colleges are not industry ready and many of them are not employable. Academia has also felt a strong need in terms of producing the necessary quality talent. It has been quite some time since industry and academia started working together to enhance the employability of engineering graduates and make them industry ready. Various models have been initiated by big industry captains to make this collaboration workable. But the big question is how effective these models are in terms of their applicability and usefulness to all the stakeholders in industry and academia. Through this paper, we discuss some of the offerings under the industry academia collaboration model. An analysis of various challenges being encountered during the evaluation of effectiveness of such models is also discussed. A few potential cost effective ways to address the underlying challenges are put forth towards the end of the paper.},

abstract={One of the significant constraints of sensor nodes is their limited battery power due to which they are prone to fail. The sensor nodes may also get damaged due to various natural hazards or other reasons. Due to these constraints the wireless sensor networks become unreliable. This paper proposes a distributed clustering approach with state-full architecture; a protocol, RS-HEED (Reliable, State-full Hybrid Energy Efficient Distributed clustering) for increasing the lifetime and reliability- of a network. RS-HEED periodically does clustering to select cluster heads on the basis of residual energy as primary parameter and communication cost as secondary parameter. RS-HEED b a query driven model and employs a connection setup phase to deliver data reliably from sensor node to base station.},

abstract={Competency development of employees in large organizations has become very important in current times of extremely volatile business environment. In order to consistently provide its customers and clients the best business solutions, employees of an organization have to be the best in their competencies. A competent team of employees is the foundation of any successful organization. A company will disentangle and fail without employees who perform at high level every day. Hence, a focused approach is the need of the day for competency development of employees covering various aspects of technical, domain, process, project management and soft skills. All skill enablement programs require a structured courseware which may help the employees to learn a given competency in a focused and planned manner. In this paper, we discuss about the importance of courseware design and development during competency development of employees. A series of challenges are argued in this regard followed by a suggested DDQ framework for courseware design and development. Towards the end, we discuss benefits and advantages of this framework for various stake holders involved during the whole exercise.},

abstract={Outcome based education gives a chance for an overall learning where an engineering graduate gets trained in all the program outcome laid by the National Board of Accreditation, India [1, 10]. This ensures that a graduate not only possess a sound knowledge in the specific program they also can have a global mobility and acceptance. In order to attain the program outcome the curriculum for the program is designed in a manner that the students get trained in all the 12 Program outcomes. The courses are taught to the students by various teaching methodologies like class room teaching, laboratory experiments, seminar and projects. Each course is designed with specific CO's and each CO is mapped to the PO. The attainment of CO's is quantified by assessing students. Their performance is tabulated and analysed using MS Excel software. The quantification methodology involves detailed question paper articulation wherein each question is mapped to a CO and its corresponding PO. Thus considering continuous internal evaluation data one can measure the attainment of CO and the PO for a batch of students. The level of attainment also can be easily varied based on the level of the course and efficiency of the student.},

abstract={The technological rebellion has made current generations to depend more on the digital world in their day to day life. The effectiveness of the digital world has changed the learner's perceptive towards the education system. The impulsivegrowth of technology has increased the popularity of Information and Communication Technology which has created a research scope in Computer network domain thus Computer network course in the curriculum of Computer Science and Engineering plays an important role. It is always a challenge to teach Computer Networks course to students as the course requires a practical exposure more than the chalk and talk. It is very hard for students to envision the concepts of computer networks, protocols formats and understanding packets flow during teaching in classroom. To overcome above said challenge, pedagogical practice such as active learning through simulation tool is identified in delivery of the course. This paper discusses the effective use of a Packet Tracer (PT) simulation tool in the teaching of computer network concepts. A structured learning approach is introduced by using packet tracer tool in teaching network concepts and series of exercises are designed and developed to give the visualization of each layer functionality. These practical exercises helped in active learning to use the packet tracer to simulate campus network. This pedagogy practice encouraged the students' to build the clarity on the physical devices like router, access points, switch and their configurations. The troubleshooting skills were practiced by introducing the errors deliberately and how to resolve is learnt through the tool. Computer network simulation activity include the concepts of NAT, Subnetting, V-LAN setting, services of TCP/UDP, packet format details, application layer protocol like DNS, DHCP, E-Mail, FTP and HTTP. Activity is evaluated through demos, presentation and quizzes. Rubrics based assessment is followed to ensure uniformity and transparencyin the evaluation. The average marks obtained in quiz by students before using PT tool is 65% and after using tool is 85%, it shows significant improvement of 20% in learning the fundamental concepts of computer network course.},

abstract={Recent technologies provide wide opportunities for learning at remote places and enables people collaboration anywhere. In this paper, we present the future advancement in the teaching learning process in India. As mobile phones and tablets are getting more keenly intellective and more widely used than in the precedent decades, they have become a familiar tool in our present environment. Utilizing them as a cognition tool calls for accommodations that are compatible with the concept of communication tools. Various studies suggest that ‘Digital education’ is comparatively more effective than traditional learning. The proposed system uses an inter network for teacher — student interaction and sharing of resources and messages. It allows knowledge-building and learning process to be run in collaborative learning environment. In this system, a student can create, collect and share inculcate data immediately anywhere, anytime. This enables them to play active role in knowledge building process. Hence, we have proposed a combination of m-learning and e-learning based application along with the concept of BYOD (bring your own device) which is advantageous to both the faculties and students of educational institutions for smart learning.},

abstract={In this study, we introduce a model that captures and visualizes the dynamical process of individual intention forming and the translation of this intention into actual behavior when learning in MOOCs. To validate the model and further our understanding of learning in MOOCs, we constructed a short survey based on this theoretically grounded intention-behavior dynamics model. This survey was sent to MOOC learners who at the time of their respective MOOCs indicated that we could contact them for further research purposes. The combination of open and closed questions referred to the most recent MOOC they took and was answered by 84 learners. The results revealed that most learners start a MOOC with a specific intention in mind, but that nearly one third of these learners reformulates this initial intention, once or more often, at some point due to barriers they encounter which hinder or prevent them from reaching their individual intentions. These barriers are mainly non-MOOC related, which may be valuable input for future research as well as guide the development of interventions for supporting learners to reach their personal learning intentions.},

pages={205-209},
abstract={Information systems are growing in both size and complexity. Object orientation has emerged as a dominant paradigm in designing and constructing such large and complex information systems, which is being taught to undergraduate students of Computer Science and Engineering. The use of java technology to develop applications is found preferred one [1]. There exists a knowledge gap between industry expectations and students knowledge. Hence deep learning of java programming is essential attribute to reduce the gap [1]. This paper presents classification of lab assignments as demonstration, Exercises, structured Enquiry type and open ended types with an approach of using conceptual model as intermediate step before writing java code for a given problem statement. This classification of assignments/problem statements move the responsibility from a professor to student where the latter involvement is observed high in achieving the objectives set for each type in classification of assignments, hence helps to meet industry expectations. The conceptual model, drawing a class diagram using standard notations (diagrammatic representations) improves the students understanding of object oriented concepts [7], for a given lab assignment which in-turn eases the student effort in translating the class diagram into program code by following the syntax. The students will be graded during assessment as Grade-S, Grade-A, Grade-B, Grade-C, Grade-D, Grade-E, Grade-F and where Grade-S is highest and Grade-F is lowest. The results of assessment are analyzed for year 2013 and 2014 batches and it is observed that, there is increase in grade A in year 2014 compared to year 2013. The observed change is due to the above said approach. The result analysis of year 2013 and 2012 shows that, the grade F is increased little in results of year 2013, it is due to the current approach where the lab assignments are classified and students are expected to apply the concepts studied effectively and few students unable to follow the approach.},

abstract={Every organization whether it be an enterprise or academic institute, should maintain a proper documentation of attendance of staff or students for effective functioning of their organization. Generally there are two methods of taking attendance in a classroom- calling out students name one by one or taking students signature on paper. However each of those strategies are time consuming, inefficient and moreover proxy can be easily given by students if strength of class is large since it is not possible to verify each student in person. A good amount of the time is wasted in taking attendance and even then many times attendance don't seem to be marked properly. Proxy of students in classroom is a perpetual problem that has to be addressed. Therefore an attendance management system is required which not only authenticates the student but also detect proxies. In this paper we combine privacy preservation and collusion resistance to propose an attendance system which uses an android application to mark student's attendance in the classroom and detect proxies given by students. It exploits the Bluetooth technology to ensure student is present in class itself rather than in the canteen or in the library. Based on the attendance given by students, a trust factor is assigned to each student to determine how trustworthy a student is.},

abstract={Students Performance can be measured under various categories like Success Rate, Academic Performance, Placement and Higher Studies and Professional Activities. Among these, Academic Performance paves the vital role in assessing their career upliftment. It is meant to be one of the key factors for assessing the departmental as well as institutional strength. The assessment can be undergone in two ways Formative and summative. We have chosen data sets from Continuous Assessment Tests for Formative assessment and Terminal Exam results for Summative assessment. In our strategy we have given more priority over the Formative Assessment. Since, when we Fine tune the student's outcome through Formative assessment we can able to expect improved Final outcome. In this paper we have proposed threshold based grading assessment strategy and the results are discussed. Interestingly, the strategy used for analyzing the outcome compared to previous successive rate correlates the final outcome. The attendance, vernacular skill set and rural locale are the prominent factors to be considered while undergoing the academic analysis.},

abstract={Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) offer web-based learning to a global audience. While we have so many institutions offering online courses, not many of them focus on laboratory courseware that would inculcate hands-on learning. Engineering is all about hands-on learning of concepts and needs an effective online laboratory courseware to complement the theoretical courses offered by MOOC. Unlike many Test and Measurement solution providers, who focus mostly on experiments based on their instruments and unidirectional flow of lab courseware, Tektronix launched an online community of lab courseware for basic teaching labs in electronics engineering. Educators across the globe can contribute to the content data base, and access the lab courseware created by other fellow educators. Template and sample lab courseware ensure that follow-on submission of courseware are rich in pedagogic elements and convers a wider spectrum of courses in electronics engineering. This paper is an attempt to present a case study of how this open-source platform is leveraged by educators to share lab courseware and enable fellow educators / students hone hands-on skills in electronics engineering.},

pages={31-33},
abstract={Since 2013, we have used all of the content from our Introduction to Biology Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) with students taking an equivalent on-campus, for-credit course in a mostly ungraded, blended manner. It appeared early on that students on campus watched the videos in high numbers, and more students answered practice problems from within video sequences than the (ungraded) problem sets or practice exams. As a follow-up, we asked, if the position of an ungraded problem impacts students' behavior to try practice problems. We hypothesized that placement of the ungraded problems in the course structure has a significant effect on the likelihood of a student attempting the problems. We predicted that ungraded problems placed immediately after a video segment within a sequence of videos would have a higher number of unique submissions compared to the same problem placed outside of the video sequence. To test our hypothesis, we performed A/B tests on the course content position of ungraded problems during both the fall 2015 and fall 2016 semesters. We positioned the ungraded problems in an appropriate video sequence or under the relevant problem set or exam available for practice in the course website. We found that more students attempted problems when the problems appeared in-between video segments for 34 out of 38 cases. Both sets of experiments (20 problems for 2015 and 18 problems for 2016) support our hypothesis that more students submitted answers to ungraded problems in the video sequence versus when we positioned the same problem in the course structure outside of the video sequence. These results indicate that the online course structure alone can influence student study behavior, a result potentially applicable to the design of blended learning experiences and MOOCs.},

The map could be personalized to recommend videos and exercises according to the knowledge nodes that had a low score. Therefore, students could learn where they needed to improve and adjust their learning accordingly. Moreover, teachers and teaching assistants could observe students' knowledge maps to understand their performance and help them accordingly.},

It goes without mentioning curriculum design and development play a significant role in creating a learning experience from the student entered fashion. Properly defined assessments with a well driven curriculum really throw a challenge to delivery methods. Thus, pedagogy is important in imparting the knowledge coupled with the requisite skill levels as specified by Dr. Benjamin Bloom. This paper is a case study of one such attempt to introduce new pedagogy by introducing the self-study component into the course delivery method. This has enabled the course instructor to create curiosity among the students in the class by way of challenging them through some minor projects and self-chosen activities to demonstrate their learning through application of the concepts learnt in the classroom and laboratory exercises. This unique change made students to think critically. The outcomes of the study are very much encouraging in two counts, one increase in the cognitive level (test marks improved) and the other is the improvement in skills through demonstrating the concepts by the students who were engaged and inquisitive.},

abstract={The primary objective of Outcome Based Education (OBE) is to ensure that the students are at par with their counterparts at a global level. The means of ensuring this is to identify each subject course outcome and measure their understanding of the subject towards this outcome. Relationship between programme outcome and course outcome provides the weightage that is to be used for the analyses of individual student. Using this analysis, corrective measures are taken for the individuals who do not meet the pre-defined criteria. This paper discusses the methodology used and extensive analysis done to identify weak students for the subject Electromechanical Energy Conversion II. Analysis is also done to evaluate the programme outcomes to see how clearly the course outcomes are defined and understood by the stakeholders viz. faculty and student for continuous teaching learning process.},

abstract={This paper examines the effects of exercise descriptions and supplied hints to achieved scores and required working times of programming exercises within a MOOC. We conducted an A/B test on more than 2.400 students using an exercise with four descriptions differing in clarity, description detail, order of presented instructions and presence or absence of exemplary program output. Results show that the expressiveness and structure of the instructions influence the required work times as well as the number of issued program runs. We suggest further experimentation to outline effects on programming errors and to determine guidelines for optimal exercise descriptions.},

abstract={It is likely that only a small proportion of educators are willing, interested, and incentivized to complete an entire MOOC, but we believe that many more can benefit from our educational resources if we empower our participants to take our materials and put them to work. We launched the MITx MOOC Envisioning the Graduate of the Future under a Creative Commons (CC) license because we think that making the content explicitly open (with the requirement of attribution) would make it easier for the target audience (teachers, administrators, and others in the education sphere) to get value from the content. The decision to use a CC license, specifically CC BY 4.0, affected course development in several ways. The course team had to learn more about the intricacies of the various CC licenses. The work of finding, tracking, logging, and labeling resources (both third-party and created by the course team) involved a great deal of collaborative, detail-oriented work. Certain resources, like commercially produced music tracks, were no longer a good fit due to conflicts regarding terms of use. From the first run of the course, we now recognize the importance of collecting data regarding how much learners know about CC licenses and also about how they are sharing, using, and adapting our content. We now believe that releasing a course under a CC license does not guarantee that learners will notice and begin sharing and adapting our content. We hope to innovate in terms of data collection to make it easier for learners to report how they are experimenting with repurposing course content.},

abstract={More we know about our learners the better are we in a position to mentor them. This is more so in engineering education as this is a professional course focusing on skills also. Prior knowledge of the learner about engineering profession and motivation level of the learner are two important factors among several others that influence learner's perception of engineering as a profession. There are several approaches used by Engineering Education practitioners to know the prior knowledge of the learner about the engineering profession. This paper discusses about one such technique - Draw an Engineer at Work Test (DAEWT) technique used by the authors to understand the prior knowledge of the learner regarding Engineering profession. Freshman Engineering students are asked to draw the sketch of an Engineer at work. Required data regarding the background of the learner is also collected. These pictures drawn by are studied with respect to their family background and their previous education setting. To know the motivation of the students to opt for engineering program, students were asked to list jobs related to specific engineering disciplines as job after graduation is considered most important motivation. This awareness in the learner is analyzed with respect to prior education setting of parents to evaluate its impact on their motivation. This paper discusses the details of the methods employed and the analysis of the results.},

abstract={In this paper, we will be discussing about active learning techniques which will enhance students' abilities and makes them to overcome the fear of studies and lack of interest. In the present day, most of the students are discontinuing their studies due to many reasons like lack of interest, lack of proper prioritization of their interest, lack of good grade and many more. There might be many reasons for students for not getting engaged into academics but the main reason which makes them uninterested is lack of proper learning or teaching activity. So, active learning is just like a root of the tree which will make students to prioritize their interests in their learning age and make them to put their efforts to reach their goal. This paper also gives a clear idea about how to structure their mind sets and follow the path which helps them to reach their goal and also helps them to prioritize their interests and helps them to adopt according to current market needs.},

abstract={Knowledge, skill and attitude are three necessary ingredients for the success of fresh graduates both in terms of learning and employability. It is important to identify suitable teaching methodology to impart transferable skills to the participants. Outcome based curricula and experiential learning pedagogies create positive influence among participants towards learning. In this paper, Java web development course is considered describing course level outcomes connected with company's entry level program level outcomes. Case studies are used as assessment instruments towards measuring the abilities of the participants aligned with expected skills from entry level developers specific to Java Technology stream. Two approaches are discussed where the first approach uses normal class room delivery and the second approach just-in-time and scenario based approach. In the former one the software engineering and java concepts are covered as factual knowledge components where as in the second approach, an attempt is made to integrate process knowledge components from software engineering together with Java technology concepts using business scenario as a vehicle. The performance of the participants with respect to their case study deliverables is compared with two approaches. These results highlight importance of an integrated approach towards curriculum design and adopting appropriate teaching, assessment instruments towards imparting technical skills.},

abstract={Considering the Massive increase in the usage of Mobile phones and handheld devices such as Tablets, iPads, there is an exponential growth in usage of Mobile apps. Mobile applications are widely used for entertainment, education, for social networks and for increasing productivity. We propose use of mobile applications to teach and to create social awareness for sensitive topics. In developing countries, topics like HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, breast cancer, autism etc. are not taken seriously due to social awkwardness, cultural taboos, education system, social barriers and gender inequality. This paper we proposes a solution to this problem. As these applications can be used personally, there will not be any hesitation compared to discussion with a real person. Interactive application that is created will be explanatory enough for users to get appropriate and correct knowledge with its validation hence, reducing misconceptions. Development of such applications will lead to better awareness and better health for individuals. As a proof of concept, Android application is developed for awareness of HIV/AIDS. After use of mobile app it brings 53.2 percent increase in average marks of knowledge test about HIV/AIDS.},

Each program outcome is achieved through course outcome. The curriculum comprising of various courses is framed under the general guidance of the leading professional body. As course outcome is mapped to program outcome it was found to vary from strong to weak. The delivery methods for various courses attain the course outcomes. Hence, the program outcome is achieved by various teaching-learning methodologies. Out of which, chalk and talk is found as the most effective mode of instruction in undergraduate curriculum despite the availability of many alternate instructional strategies.

abstract={Since 2014 one focus of our research is looking into the effects of integrating Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in traditional education. We have developed in the past different methods of integration: as a full course recognition, partial course recognition, or project/activity based recognition of a MOOCs course completion, into a traditional higher education face-to-face course. The experience on integrating MOOCs in courses at Master level is presented and discussed in this paper. The analyse is based on questionnaires, reports and live discussions with students, during the whole academic semester. Studying online, open education and MOOCs still represent terms students are not familiar with, in Romania in particular. Still, we consider that the Open Life Long Learning Student need to acquire a new set of skills in an independent and self-determined manner as to identify, access, learn, analyse, apply and practice new knowledge using different media, information channels, and communication tools to enhance their skills and develop their careers. The authors proposed an asynchronous online course work to be integrated with the traditional in-class instruction. We looked into the students' interaction with MOOCs, the use of different tools, the educational value of learning online and the MOOCs impact. The conclusions present both strengths and deficiencies of integrating MOOCs based on this blended learning study case.},

abstract={In online collaborative learning, students use text-based posts to communicate with their instructor and their peers. Student's posts can be numerous, yet superficial in their content, often not addressing the objectives of the learning. Collaboration is one indicator of student engagement in an online learning task. The Conversational Framework and Social Network Analysis (SNA) pedagogical tools are used to measure the quality of collaboration. For the comparative analysis discussed in this paper, these tools were examined to identify the: purpose of each tool; the process each tool uses; and identifying what is similar or different as well as any benefits to the instructor and/or students. Each tool is diagrammatically represented. The discussion situates these tools within the benefits of measuring quality collaboration in online learning tasks. The paper concludes by identifying the need for further investigation into other tools measuring collaboration as part of the proposed PhD research.

abstract={Over the last few decades, technology is increasingly becoming an important aspect of delivering education in formal and informal contexts. While it is true in broader sense, the technology integration has not been widespread and penetrating in developing countries. Moreover the use of traditional technology media such as audio systems and computers have been there for some time, the new media technology integration has been minuscule. The other dimension of technology use in education is the technology acceptance behaviour of users i.e. students and teachers. While it is easier to enumerate the benefits of technology use, it is more difficult to answer as to why users use or reject any technology. This paper utilises Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology to understand the students' acceptance of a Learning Management System in an engineering and Science institute of higher education.},

abstract={Capstone project (CP) is an important part of every engineering and computer science discipline at undergraduate level. The main purpose of these capstone projects is to encourage students to apply the knowledge acquired during their studies in previous semesters, in particular a capacity to personally manage and conduct a complex, open-ended project to show how proficient they are in solving real world or the research based problems. The Outcome Based Education (OBE) is an education system that emphasis on outcomes measurement rather than inputs of curriculum covered. Outcomes may include a range of knowledge, skills and attitudes. In order to obtain the desired outcomes, teaching components and activities should be well organized, planned and continuously improved. We adopted OBE in our curriculum and for the course on project work we have written course learning objectives (CLO), i.e. at the end of the course the student should be able satisfy these objectives and they are mapped with the program outcomes (PO). This paper presents a novel method for the outcome-based assessment of engineering capstone project carried by Final Year Students. The assessment is done based on the rubrics written for each phase of the process. The outcome of the each phase is assessed by evaluation team and the guide using the assessment matrix which is based on assessment rubrics. Assessment matrix covers all the attributes/parameters for the assessment of each phase. Mapping of CLO-PO is done based on these attributes. Percentage of attainment of each objective and outcome are calculated.},

abstract={Education apart from the basic needs of food, clothing and shelter, is another key factor to empower an individual. It acts as an enabler to elevate a person socially and from within. Education system has been evolving since human existence and various approaches are being used to teach. Focusing on professional courses, the quality of education is questioned and stands as a concern along with the unemployment issues. In India, there is a huge potential for technology growth. However, as per the National employability report, only 3.84% of engineers qualify for a startup technology role. Further, 2016 employability rate has been 17.91%, 3.67% and 40.57% for IT Services, IT Products and Business Process Outsourcing respectively. Apart from this, there are many forums in which the quality of education is being questioned, since education is linked with the job or business opportunity. One of the essentials in the professional courses is the curriculum design. It is very important to start with the curriculum that can enhance the knowledge of students and also make a prospective career. With these in mind, the improvement options have to be deeply thought and charted out. In this regard, a survey has been taken up with engineering professionals to get their feedback on how they view the education system. This paper focuses on the feedback from working engineering professionals, compares the existing and other curriculum options and provides a proposal for a value based curriculum design.},

Reviews of such models are elucidated in detail of this context. An ideal education system should be modelled to unleash a student's potential & natural caliber. This can be achieved by a gradual transformation towards intuitive learning. Talent and knowledge gained by a graduate is never directly proportional to reputation of university from which the degree has been obtained. In today's world, the reputation of a college depends on the marks of its students and not necessarily on the quality of knowledge imparted by it. Competition is on a major upward growth and there is a dire need for the graduates to stand out and make their mark. Review about the system architecture and of the existing model of education reveals that we focus more on the performance of the students than the effectiveness of their performance. Necessity for technical knowledge about the specialization subject along with the domains which would be required in industry has been explained along with the various innovative models of educations.},

abstract={Outcome-based education (OBE) has become a necessity to make our engineering graduates employable and globally acceptable. OBE is an educational theory that bases each part of an educational system around goals (outcomes). It is expected that after graduation, each student should have achieved the basic purpose of education i.e. necessary skills to work in his/her area of specialization/interest. The assessment is crucial factor in the OBE, as the success of OBE lies in the continuous assessment of the goals and implementing the changes based on the feedback of assessment.

As a result of the ever-growing social media, it has turned into an essential scheme for viral marketing and influencing the masses. Hence, it becomes imperative to discern how information spreads on such networks and how much. The methodology suggested in the Restrained-Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (RnSIR) Model enables us to calibrate the spread of knowledge and material on networks. This paper proposes an interface which uses the calculations given by the RnSIR model. Essentially, this interface prompts users to give a network interaction data set as the input and outputs the information dispersion on inputted network. It uses the same algorithms to do this as the RnSIR model.},

abstract={Engineering education has been growing with ever increasing number of engineering branches. With the advent of technology awareness of the students and their environment makes even more challenging task for the educator to enforce the process of learning. Traditional methods alone may not be successful in the pedagogical domain in which the engineering students are. The paper has analyzed real time feedbacks from engineering students to bring forth the most optimal teaching techniques which suit engineering graduate studies. Efforts have been made to diversify the sample pool across geographies using survey tools inbuilt in Google. This has ensured almost a prejudice free survey response. The paper concludes with experimental teaching - learning methodologies for theory as well as practical oriented subjects.},

abstract={Preserving the secrecy of confidential information transmitted over a network has always been of utmost importance. Increasing use of data communication over networks also increases the need of security. Steganography is a technique that screens the existence of information by masking it behind some other seemingly innocuous media. But if the presence of information behind media is revealed by any method, the main purpose of steganography is violated. This paper proposes and analyzes a technique for steganography named Compress-Encrypt-Stego that pre-processes the text before hiding it behind a cover image. In pre-processing, the text is first compressed and then modified using a key. Processed text is then concealed behind cover image using transform domain based steganography. DCT is used to transform the cover image to frequency domain. The technique is implemented for various cover images and for different values of plain text and keys using MATLAB. The proposed technique is analyzed by varying the number of bits used to hide the data. This paper also discusses the security analysis of the proposed technique.},

abstract={MOOCs are arriving to the business sector. Especially within Human Resource Development and customer training. While some companies offer their own MOOCs, a few companies use external MOOCs to complement their HR offers. However, the awareness and perception level among HR managers in general is still lower as expected. On the other hand, many learners are taking MOOCs to upgrade their skills for the current job or to open up new career pathways. This indicates that employees and business learners are already making use of MOOCs on a global level, which leads us to the assumption that there is a significant bottom-up movement from professional lifelong learners in MOOCs. As there are no specific studies available for the European context, this article sets out to answer the research question if this bottom-up movement in the uptake of MOOCs by employees can be confirmed for Europe.},

abstract={The rapid and impressive development of MOOCs in less than half a decade has brought about contrasting arguments about the social dimension of MOOcs. This paper investigates how the socio-economic background of learners affects their own experience in the on-line course and their chances of course completion. We test whether learners from low SES have lower chances of completing the on-line course and whether participation in online discussion forums mediates the role of SES. Analyzing data from two MOOcs provided by Stanford University, we find that in both cases the hypothesis of a negative association between low SES background and course completion is supported. Moreover, we find that forum participation further reinforces the advantage of well-educated learners enrolled in one case, while does not have any significant effect for the other course. We conclude with some design implications for creators of on-line courses.},

abstract={Quality is directly related with satisfaction of the learner and one can satisfy only if the learning environment provides full technical and infrastructure support and interactive user interface. Quality Analytics is the discovery and the systematic computational analysis of data statistics to find meaningful patterns especially valuable in areas rich with recorded information. Quality Analytics of learning environment evaluates the application based on various relevant quality parameters such as Business Qualities, Generic Qualities, System Qualities and Learner Response Qualities. These parameters should be focused upon to design analytical pattern to monitor the learner behavior. If any of the web-based application fails to deliver these then it clearly reflects the compromise in the quality of the product. ISO/IEC 19796-1 international standard focuses on quality management and assurance in e-Learning and it is also mandatory to scrutinize and assess the results generated by various quality factors in dynamic web based learning environment. This paper proposes analytics based method to generate and monitor values of some critical quality factors. Effective assessment of these factors is helpful in tuning the overall performance of dynamic web based learning environment and the analytics confirm the learner behavior towards the learning application.},

However, team projects are complex. Previous studies have explored various design spaces, such as team formation [1], project selection [2], team coaching [3], and student evaluation [4]; while others have reported experience regarding the design, organization, teaching, and evolution of a project -based software engineering curriculum [5,6,7,8]. The complexity of team projects explains why we rarely see large-scale software engineering courses with a team project.

abstract={Computation is becoming an integral part of education, especially at college-level. Two MOOC courses provide an introduction to computation and are offered by MIT on EdX: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python has run 16 times and 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science has run 11 times. These courses frame the world around computation, and show learners that they can think about problems they see in everyday life in the context of computation. Our paper shows an analysis of repeat learners (learners who enroll in the same course multiple times) and their behaviors over the many runs of these courses. Around 20% of learners in any given run of a course are repeat learners. Of these, the majority are two-time repeat learners (learners who took the same course exactly twice). We show that learners tend to perform better when they retake a course, and especially when they retake the course sooner rather than later. We also look at a subgroup of learners we call repeat cross-referencers (learner who accessed at least two previous runs of the course during the run time of a later run of the course). We found that repeat cross-referencers complete the course at a suspiciously high rate, and we speculate it is because they are looking back at answers from a previous course run. Lastly, we look at how learners perform in an introductory class and an advanced class. We found that many learners who take both courses are more likely to complete both courses and have more active days in the courses than those learners who only do one of the two classes.},

abstract={Creation of a technology enabled social learning ecosystem was started as an experiment in 2014 at the BMS College of Engineering, in partnership with WIKSATE. This platform available to the students for use anytime, anywhere, in any smart device, enabled them to connect and share with their peers 24×7, and learn as they interact even while on the move. The implementation of the platform was expanded gradually over the years to support all the departments and courses. This platform is now available to the entire college. With over 3500 students actively engaged in supplementing their formal education with social learning, the BMS College of Engineering is now the largest social learning ecosystem in India. The WIKSATE platform provides the students at the BMS College of Engineering, a powerful interaction engine to connect and share their learnings with their co-learners in a knowledge network. Further, this platform provides real-time data to faculty which give insight into student preferences and engagement and help plan continuous improvements in the course delivery and outcome. It also helps promoting a culture of openness and moderated learning providing a vital bridge to close the gap between educators and students. The results from the social learning analytics show that students have a natural motivation and inquisitiveness to get involved in interactions when empowered by a mobile centric ubiquitous access to knowledge networks. The results also show a steady growth of student interactions at all levels after their induction into the ecosystem.},

abstract={The proposed Brain-Computer Interface system enables Quadriplegic patients, people with severe motor disabilities to send commands to electronic devices and communicate with ease. Interactive sessions are vital for effective knowledge transfer in any learning eco-system. The growth of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) has led to rapid development in 'Assistive Systems' for the disabled called 'assistive domotics'. Brain-Computer-Interface is capable of reading the brainwaves of an individual and analyse it to obtain some meaningful data. This processed data can be used to assist people having speech disorders and sometimes people with limited locomotion to communicate. In this Project, Emotiv EPOC Headset is used to obtain the electroencephalogram (EEG). The obtained data is processed to communicate pre-defined commands and queries for interactive learning. EEG data can also be used to monitor student's emotional behaviour and provide emotional feedback to the students. Other Vital Information like the heartbeat, blood pressure, ECG and temperature are monitored and uploaded to the server. The Data is processed in Intel Edison, system on chip (SoC). Patient metrics are displayed via Intel IoT Analytics cloud service.},

abstract={Online Labs (OLabs) is an innovative learning tool focused on virtual laboratory experiments for secondary school education. The purpose of this present study is to examine student perceptions regarding learning when using simple lowcost activities (Activity Based Learning (ABL)) that teach the same concepts as the corresponding science OLabs experiment. Our sample consisted of 131 students (male=66, female=65) studying in the 8th grade. All students had the same level of exposure to science courses at the school. A five-point Likert scale questionnaire was administered to understand students' interest, ease of use and attitude towards OLabs-based ABL. The investigation revealed that a sizable majority of the students, were excited about using OLabs based ABL methodology, in their current curriculum as well as in the future. The gender based analysis showed that female candidates were more interested in using ABL methodology. Our findings contribute to the design of a new pedagogy model for incorporating low-cost science activities with virtual labs to reach students in schools that do not have access to science labs.},

Usually different circuits are used for each experiment, and sometimes, `plug-in' modules are used to connect and observe waveforms at different stages of the modulator. The single circuit proposed can be used to generate the three forms of amplitude modulation: standard amplitude modulation (DSB); double side band suppressed carrier (DSB-SC); single side band (SSB); and three forms of digital modulation like the amplitude shift keying (ASK); binary phase shift keying (BPSK); frequency shift keying (FSK). In addition, the same circuit is used to generate natural sampled waveform and the two-channel time division multiplexed waveform. We discuss the method and then present the experimental results.},

abstract={Currently the traffic control system in place in our country is non-flexible and non-adaptive to the ever growing number of vehicles on the road. It does not take into account the changing density of traffic during the different hours of the day. Consequently the roads get congested frequently and intersections get blocked. Time and fuel, two highly important resources get wasted in this inefficient working of the present-day system. In this article, we propose a dynamic system that overcomes all these drawbacks. Our system uses cameras installed at the red lights and intersections to monitor the traffic dynamically. It then processes this information using image processing, computes the volume of the real time traffic, sets the timer of the signal accordingly. Simultaneously, it monitors if there is any scope of congestion at the intersection and adjusts the timer to prevent it. The entire system works autonomously and has a quick turnaround time, saving critical resources at every junction. The system also has the potential to adopt machine learning techniques in order to recognize the different emerging patterns of the future traffic and reach an optimal solution.},

abstract={During the last decades, our society is witnessing an authentic revolution that, in a dizzying manner has deeply influenced, modified, and transformed the way of life of human beings. This constant and unstoppable revolution is transmuting all areas of our life: social, cultural, personal, labor, economic, training, etc. This new society is characterized by a high generation of knowledge and the constant and fluid processing of information. In this macro-context, the MOOC phenomenon emerged. MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) courses are based on the principles of massive, free access to all materials and resources offered online. This new didactic path can be constituted in an innovative techno-social tendency, especially oriented in the panorama of Higher Education to stimulate university improvement, open opportunities at the same time for education and training or, simply, derive towards a new business model for the universities. In addition to being an entry point for the popularization of science and knowledge, the future possibilities are enormous and are being studied in all their various dimensions. Many initiatives as a result have been developed to implement this new form of education. MOOC Courses and the Future of Higher Education presents the latest research theories and current examples of MOOC courses practices in Higher Education. The chapters represent an extensive assortment of interpretations and practices examples of MOOC courses, across areas as varied as teaching methodologies, instructional innovations, educational technology, etc. This work is structured in three sections, the first one covers the university institution in the knowledge society, the second analyzes the MOOC training proposals, and the third discusses the future role of MOOCs.

abstract={In the last few decades workplace of engineers have become global and the employers expect them to acquire skills that will prepare them to meet the complex challenges of global workplaces. Many studies have pointed out that the gap between the expectations of the industry and academic preparation is widening due to the engineers’ lack of employability skills. Employability skills are important as they help an individual prepare and sustain in a job. But finding a suitable place and pedagogy for them in engineering curriculum has been a matter of debate in academia.This paper is a work in progress model proposed in an institute in India. It proposes to include MOOCs in the curriculum with the aim to inculcate the skillsets required in the 21st century engineers. It argues that the inclusion of MOOCs will provide many benefits for the engineering graduates, teachers and recruiters from the industry.},

abstract={Filter designing has been an important field in communication. The filter to be designed is needed to have some basic characteristics like narrow transition width, high output SNR, less hardware complexity and low cost. In this paper IIR filters have been designed and simulated for Myriametre band. Their performance analysis and cost comparisons have been done. Butterworth filter is found to be least hardware complex with Elliptic filter having smallest transition width. Butterworth filter requires 25% less adders and multipliers with better pass band SNR and group delay responses than Elliptic and Chebyshev II filters. However transition width of Elliptic filter are 47.37%, 88.63% and 96.8% smaller than Butterworth filter for N=8, 16 and 24 respectively.},

abstract={In spite of establishment of many private and state universities in India, the demand for university education in the last 20 years is far greater than the supply. There has been unsatisfied supply of university education in India since the 1990/91 academic year when over 60% of candidates demanding for university education failed to secure admissions. The Government of India has approved guidelines for the establishment of higher institutions of learning in India which are contained in the Education (UGC & AICET). There is also the Education Act of an India, 1987. Some of the guidelines are that: An institution of Higher Education may be sponsored or owned by the Government of the State or Local Government or by a Company incorporated in India or by an individual or association of individuals who are citizens of India, and who satisfy the criteria set out in the Schedule to the law for establishment of institutions. In 2003, the UGC of India passed a law permitting establishment of private universities. The private university act mandates the state body as well as UGC to regulate and undertake quality control of the content and curricula of academic programs. It is noticed that some newly approved private universities not following UGC Regulation 2009 which leads to failure of doctoral candidates who takes admission referring to allowed universities list from UGC website.},

abstract={Gesture recognition turns up to be important field in the recent years. Communication through gestures has been used since early ages not only by physically challenged persons hut nowadays for many other applications. Interacting with physical world using expressive body movements is much easier and effective than just speaking As most predominantly hand is used to perform gestures. Hand Gesture Recognition have been widely accepted for numerous applications such as human computer interactions, robotics, sign language recognition, etc Hand Gesture recognition techniques are basically divided into vision based and sensor based techniques. This paper focuses on vision based hand gesture recognition system by proposing a scheme using a database-driven hand gesture recognition based upon skin color model approach and thresholding approach along with an effective template matching using PCA. Initially, hand region is segmented by applying skin color model in YCbCr color space. In the next stage otsuthresholding is applied to separate foreground and background. Finally, template based matching technique is developed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for recognition. The system is tested with 4 gestures with 5 different poses per gesture from 4 subjects making 20 images per gesture and shows 91.25% average accuracy and 0.098251 seconds average recognition time and finally confusion matrix is drawn.},

Learner interactions with Intelligent Tutoring Systems yield fine-grained data that are useful in generating meaningful information and illuminating understanding about learner behaviors and outcomes. We examine and analyze the log files generated by BioWorld, an Intelligent Tutoring System for the medical domain. More specifically, to further our understanding of the nature of reasoning employed by learners while solving virtual patient cases in BioWorld, one important step is to examine the initial list of selected diagnostic hypotheses before any other learner action is taken in diagnosing a case. By exploring the link between initial selected hypotheses and final submitted hypothesis, a better understanding of the learners' reasoning might be achieved.},

abstract={The paper emphasizes the need for teaching and learning mathematically intensive theory subjects using very powerful software tools. Under Electrical Engineering discipline, there are subjects like Signals & systems, Control Systems, Digital Signal/Image Processing etc. where teachers need to spend a considerable amount of time in classroom, teaching the mathematical concepts, ending up with very low level of learning by students. Learners find it very complex and unrelated as mere lecturing doesn't help them in effective interpretation of the information conveyed. There are many such software tools available nowadays having a powerful graphical data flow programming environment with a rich set of library functions and tools sets in simulation and real time mode. Such tools can simplify the teaching and learning of subjects with intense mathematical background in lesser time for the students from non-electronics stream. Here we present the efforts of teachers in learning and teaching, Signal acquisition, processing and analysis techniques for sixth semester students of Automation and Robotics in a much effective manner, using LabVIEW tool. The processed data can be presented from the tool using measurement graphs, indicators, animations, tabulated data, automated calculations, physical interpretation, visualization effects etc., thus enabling the learner with better understanding of concepts. Here we present the results of extensive use of tool to teach and learn different signal processing and analysis techniques used for biomedical signals along with the experience shared by teachers and students undergoing the activity. Course projects implemented by students after undergoing the proposed activity helped teachers to know the accelerated process of learning of the basic concepts of signal processing by students.},

In our workflow the autoevaluated programming exercises are created as if we were doing some test-driven development where the problem is our functionality and the unit tests are actually the verifications done to generate hints and evaluate the students. Once the problem is designed the unit tests create a code, based on the answer and the Anonymous userID, code that is obfuscated using an encryption technique. That code is used as the answer of a standard Open edX problem, creating a completely automated personalized environment and avoiding the use of Open Response Assessment tools that depend on the correction of other students.},

abstract={Imparting knowledge uniformly in a class is of a paramount importance in the assimilation of course content by a student. The performance level of a student may be elevated if the day-to-day study load is kept uniform. A lecture barchart is useful in maintaining the uniformity and in knowing the extent of preparedness of syllabus. The burden on a student at the time of final examination may be lowered by conducting intermittent tests to enable a student to understand and assimilate the subject better due to repeated reading. The teacher's preparation, by reading several books other than the prescribed books and by referring to the expert lectures, plays a significant role in imparting knowledge with clarity and with a practical relevance. The dissemination of knowledge could be improved through visuals and animated figures. The various means to improve the quality of teaching and the receptiveness of a student are described in this paper.},

abstract={Research is born and brought up in universities and reputed institutions. The engineering education is having significant contribution towards research. Engineers play an important role in development of technologies in all the fields and facilitate them to lay man. This happens only through research. Scientific Research is well disciplined study in order to find the solution, prove a theory or answer the particular question. Research scholars have to follow the series of steps and protocols to succeed in research. One of the main goal of Postgraduate (PG) program is exploring the students to research. PG students of engineering education are from different circuit branches and peers knowledge level is also different. So it is a big challenge for the faculties to explore the students towards research. In this article authors propose the linking of courses in the PG curriculum to focus more on research and pedagogical activities to encourage the students for doing research. Workshop conduction, Industrial visit, Presentations and Publication are the pedagogical activities practiced by the authors. The impact of these activities results in 88% of students publishing papers in international journal with impact factor 1.05.},

abstract={Assessing the quality of MOOCs is an important issue for learners since learners are paying fees for accessing the content (e.g. graded assignments), certificates of completion and for course credit. One of the unique advantages of online courses is that all the content can be assessed and analyzed even before the courses are released using various learning analytical and natural language processing tools. However, to date there are few studies in the literature published on the analysis of MOOC content. Furthermore, MOOC providers expect the course developers to periodically revise their MOOCs. Various types of analysis that can be done on the course text, video transcripts and assessments such as readability, listenability, videolytics, and text analysis. By analyzing the course content before its release, the content can be adjusted to target various learners. Subsequently, the same techniques can be used to analyze the discussion board posts and post-course survey to identify areas in a course that need to be modified in to order to improve the course quality for subsequent release. In this paper natural language processing and MOOC analytics were applied to several MOOCs to identify areas for revision to enhance their quality.},

abstract={The Covid-19 pandemic is changing our society on diverse dimensions (not only on an economic or social level). Before the 1970s, various businesses and economics could affect and improve technologies, and humans' life. Since we reached the 70ies, and with the beginning of the 3rd wave or the post-industrial era, the new modern technologies such as Information Technology (IT), Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Business (IoB), Internet of Energy (IoE), Internet of Manufacturing (IoM), Internet of Health (IoH), the emerging digitization, and innovative smartness in addition, issues such as know-how, do-how, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and others could influence businesses, the economy, urban infrastructures, societies, social impacts and even human life. Wars, sanctions, sciences, technologies, IT, IoT, and smartness work together and have impacts on each other's, businesses, economy, and human life. Fundamentally, during humans' history inventions and innovations have been created through restrictions and challenges. Wars, sanctions, low sustainability, risks of contagion, recessions, climate pollution, environmental change, biodiversity collapse, urban sprawl, growing urbanizations, lack of infrastructure, gentrification, economic instabilities, and recently health crises are introduced as main restrictions. Wars and welfare integrate with human's life desirably or undesirably and make innovation. Improvement through such innovative digital technologies are so admirable because most of them have changed the world. Sustainability has an important role for societies and urbans to improve their quality of livability and life. The world academic economy has changed from an academic SocioEdu economy to a data and innovative academic SocioEdu, ecosystem and economy, leading to the concept of the "Internet of Business-Education". with many popular IoT applications involved (i.e. wearables, smart city, smart society, smart healthcare, smart welfare, smart SMEs, smart retail, smart supply chain). This pandemic throws a spotlight on the interdependencies among business, nature, society, economy, and education. It may be tempting right now, when it is hard to see beyond the next few weeks, to dismiss the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a distraction. But they have been described as a "crowd-sourced purchase order from the future" precisely because they offer a tremendous business opportunity. Based on SDGs all developed and developing countries in a global partnership have to go with CSR strategies and Hybrid Businesses for improving social cohesion and welfare, health, education, inequality, blue-green environmental sustainability, and economic efficiency. In this article we will discuss how the 5th Wave/Tomorrow Age and i-Sustainability Plus theories could help us for a readiness to forecast, prevent and face to the SocioEdu Consequences of Covid-19.},

abstract={Developmental theories have established that adults are learning oriented only when they are convinced that there is a need to learn to effectively deal with real-life challenges.

If learning could leverage employee know-how and further it, we would be able to customize learning to an individual's need. In the managerial space, we have opportunities where employees across levels and roles in the organization have access to the same content. In a scenario like this, learners ask the question-why should I refer to this source of knowledge? If learning could leverage employee know-how and further it, we would be able to customize learning to an individual's need. Even if we talk about only the managerial space, we have opportunities where employees across levels and roles in the organization have access to the same content. This paper is a case in point of the opportunity to customize and adapt content such that it leverages employee experiences to find meaningful and different value in the education path and process of every learner.},

Here we have proposed a platform that utilizes the combination of biometric scanners, speech to text conversion techniques and image processing techniques to make the process of learning effective, interesting, and collaborative. We have added a tool that uses today's modern mobile technology to take attendance and reduce the wastage of valuable time in the class. Also we developed a tool, called Smart notes that have ability to reduce the burden of taking notes on students and worry about the knowledge gap between sections of the same campus. To reach out to every student we have found that the Instant Chatting tool introduced will be helpful to clear all the doubts. This tool can be used to for group discussions and to perform group activities. Hence the platform introduced integrated with three tools provides an excellent quality of education to fulfill every students need in comparison to the existing methods.},

abstract={Many real time applications, they are generated continues flow of data streams have became more popular now a days. Therefore many researches attracted clustering data streams. Most of data stream clustering algorithms based on distance function which find out clusters with spiracle of shape clusters and unable to deal noisy data. Therefore density based clustering algorithms substitute remarkable solution to find out clusters with arbitrary shapes of cluster and also handling noisy data. In which the clustering is performing with the bases of high density area of objects and also segregate low density objects as noise. In this paper we studied a simple existing data stream clustering algorithm DenStream based on DBScan. Based on DenStream a novel data stream clustering approach “DDenStream” is proposed. DDenStream is a modified data stream clustering algorithm of DenStream. It is based on fading window model therefore it applies a density decaying technique when the evolving data streams are captured and improved the quality of clusters by extracts the boundary points when two or more than microclusters are overlapping each other by using DCQ-Means algorithms. This approach also resolved the overlapping problem of microclusters. It find out arbitrary specs and good quality of clusters with noise.},

The review highlights an innovative approach of requesting students of computer science to become active members of existing OS communities as part of their curriculum. The acquisition of a wide range of skills, increasing student motivation, support for contextual learning and student-centered courses as well as the availability of a wealth of data to inform and support decision-making by educators are the main advantages as identified by the SLR. Similarly, high barriers to entry in OS projects, difficulties related to student support, assessments, grouping of students and choice of an adequate OS project are the potential challenges. In this paper, the advantages and challenges of using OS in an existing framework of a course design and delivery have been discussed in detail. In particular, the potential impact of OS in computer science education curriculum has been explored from the perspective of education providers.},

abstract={In the current pandemic emergency, where everything changed in a matter of hours, many fields have confronted the situation with emergency responses, in many cases, with openness and collaborative approach. In the context of education, some view the current emergency as an opportunity for digital transformation and innovation in education. However, the emergency responses to have the desired impact in the long term, need to be strategically thought-through and planned. In this paper, we argue that open practices, sound design and virtual mobility based on administrative support principles can bring opportunities for quality education. Moreover, we reconceptualize and recontextualize the notions of blended, hybrid and flexible learning within this situation. The current paper is a conceptual contribution drawing on a case of a university experience, with a radical transformation focus, contextualized in current covidl9 educational emergency. To conclude, we propose a Hybrid Flexible Learning Framework based on two main pillars: virtual mobility and design that could be a useful conceptual tool for the current situation but also for future consideration, beyond the crisis.},

abstract={This paper proposes an architecture for Outcome Based Engineering Education (OBEE). Outcome Based Education (OBE) is one of the most substantial move in Engineering Education in recent years. The paper suggests an innovative and productive way to achieve outcome based education by S. M. A. R. T (Specific, Measurable, Achivable, Reliastic, Time Bound) approach. This research emphasizes on SMART OBEE Architecture which an ideal teacher must follow. The architecture consist of 5 layers namely Build layer, Assessment layer, Feedback layer, Target layer and Time management layer. Build layer provides the direction towards development of Course Objectives. Through content delivery, teacher can assess the students using various assessment tools. A feedback can be taken from the students in order to enhance the quality of the course. Time management layer is an integrated layer and provides synchronization among all the activities in Engineering education framework which is drawn. The proposed system also defines the term SMART Teacher.},

pages={68-72},
abstract={Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) generally have two modes of course delivery: the instructor-paced mode with multiple fixed deadlines to complete assessments or the self-paced mode with a final deadline when the course closes. Many MOOC platform providers have shifted from delivering courses in instructor-paced mode to self-paced mode, assuming that a longer, flexible schedule allows learners to better engage with and complete courses. Although this question of self-paced versus instructor-paced is not new, the answer is still relevant given that studies comparing the two course delivery modes of MOOCs provided mixed results and the pressure to run all MOOCs as self-paced. In this study, we took a deeper look into learner engagement differences between the two course delivery modes for one quantitative biology course and one computer programming course. Despite the differences in enrollment numbers and content, we found similar trends between both courses involving benefits to instructor-paced over self-paced delivery, especially when evaluating more engaged behaviors like posting to the discussion forum or submitting a problem answer. Interestingly, most completers finished the courses across 80-90% of the available days in an instructor-paced run. For self-paced runs, the median range of time a completer was active was less than one fifth of the time the course was open, but some completers did take advantage of finishing the course in a smaller or maximum window of time. We also found that most completers were active a similar total number of days in self-paced and instructor-paced course runs, despite having more days available in the self-paced runs and that the activity per day per completer was lower in self-paced delivery mode for both courses.},

abstract={The traditional approach of teaching programming courses is teachers centric where students are passive learners. Also for such courses, the laboratory and classes are conducted separately. This paper focuses on integrating classroom and laboratory with hands-on for programming course. This approach is student centric which brings in active learning. However it has been less researched area and adequate literature is not available on 'hands-on science' specifically for programming course. The work presented in this paper also extends from our previous work where debugging, code optimization and testing are emphasized. In the proposed approach each teaching session consisted of hands-on teaching and activities to support it. This requires strategic planning of the course and its delivery as discussed in the paper. Applying this approach, there is increase in the number of students scoring higher grades and overall improvement in the average. The paper also discusses the benefits and challenges of hands-on discovered in this case study that triggers further research.},

abstract={The University of South Africa (UNISA) is the largest committed open distance learning (ODL) institution in South Africa. In line with ODL principles, UNISA has rolled out electronic (e)-learning to all undergraduate modules as from 2013. An important challenge for the university has been the transition from the traditional paper-based mode of instruction to e-learning. This transition requires an e-readiness strategic plan prior to the e-learning rollout. E-learning readiness comprises an intricate, in-depth, continuous process of identifying critical issues that may impede the successful rollout of e-learning within the institution. There are a host of factors that need to be considered prior to embarking on an e-learning initiative which have not been considered prior to the e-learning rollout initiative of 2013. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for an e-learning readiness framework that can be used proactively for new e-learning initiatives and retrospectively to evaluate existing e-learning interventions to identify weaknesses in current e-learning practices. The objective of this paper is to improve interactive technology-enriched teaching with regard to e-learning practices.},

abstract={The status of education has always been the primary factor of a nation that defines its academic capital, human resource and vision of development. Sheathing this education sector with the recent advancements of technology would be one of the most concrete steps towards national development. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have evolved as a new paradigm of digitized open education which could be implemented in a massive domain of India. In a developing country like India where significantly large number of people live in rural areas and cannot afford quality education, MOOCs can definitely be considered as game-changer. The authors have worked over different aspects and strategy for implementing MOOCs over the vast domain of India. In this connection, different issues haunting implementation and their possible way outs have also been discussed briefly. On one hand with a more flexible and massive approach, MOOCs would be able to impart quality education over a huge domain of audience. On the other hand it would nurture the tremendously viable business opportunity in education sector. In this context, India is viewed as a potential leader and game-changing superpower of education in Asia pertaining to Vision 2020.},

abstract={Even today, there are institutions that, due to technical problems, lack of workers with the appropriate skills or because they do not have a sufficient budget, do not have an internet connection in the classroom where technology-related subjects are taught. Through this article we propose a new hybrid teaching method that combines the Open Massive Online Course (MOOC) and face-to-face work of the students. First, we present the problems identified along our experience. Secondly, we define both, the classroom resources and the educational resources we have used. In a next step, we describe in detail the architecture of the system and the communications that compose the proposed learning hybrid system. We have assessed that the proposed solution is valid, but we are planning to deploy pilot tests to indicate the features and limitations which can be addressed when teachers use this proposal. These pilot tests are framed within STEM and robotics education. The content to assess the solution in a future is also included in this paper.},

abstract={Graduate programs in engineering have theoretical courses like Software Engineering, Information Systems, Advanced Software Engineering, Software Architecture, Management and Entrepreneurship as part of the curriculum. These courses are challenging from both the students' and the instructors' points of view. From student feedback it has been seen that they view these subjects uninteresting due to a lack of practical component. The instructor's responsibility increases in making such theoretical subjects interesting for the students. These courses impart certain unique skills which the students need to apply in their professional careers. But the Lecture method which is still the most practiced and preferred one does not provide for active student involvement. To combat this problem a variety of teaching modes have been developed from different learning theories. Several of these techniques are in use in Post-graduate courses and corporate training courses where the number of participants is less. The author has tried some of these techniques like story-telling or case study approach, involved assignment and group correction, reverse knowledge transfer, i.e. teaching by students, etc. while teaching Information Systems for two sections of undergraduate students and has found reasonable success. This paper describes the techniques used by the author, the methodology, the implementation and the results thereof. Attempt has been made using quizzes/tests to draw conclusions about the viability and applicability of these innovative techniques in classes where the number of students is more than fifty.},

abstract={Recently, most of the engineering educational institutions are assessing their degree programmes for improving their curriculum design, teaching methodologies, assessment and evaluation process. There are clear guidelines prescribed by the Government accreditation bodies of each country for defining, assessing various graduate Programme Outcomes (POs). There are two ways to assess the POs such as direct and indirect assessment. Direct assessment of the programme outcomes includes various curricular components such as continuous assessment, final examination, assignments and projects etc. In general, indirect assessment of the programme outcomes includes various survey components. We have followed the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) body of India, for defining and assessing our Information Technology (IT) programme outcomes. This paper includes the efficient strategies that we have practiced in our programme for improving the POs of undergraduate IT programme. We have grouped POs into three major categories such as knowledge, skill and attitude. Along with NBA guidelines for assessing the graduate degree programme, we have considered few other assessment components such as co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. In this paper, we have discussed the IT programme outcomes of the past three batches of students and their improvements year-by-year. From the results, it is evident that the strategies improved the entire POs of IT programme at our institution.},

abstract={Stable task assignment among processors is a shrewd effort because such approaches require priori information about current processor load and then perform allocation. Initial policy structure includes no information about processor load but as the task groups arrive and get scheduled, this information acts as a prerequisite for next allocation. The task of load stability is tricky when static scheduling strategies are followed in allocation because these strategies require supplementary efforts to balance the load as the approaches designed so far do not follow load stability criteria during task allocation; rather they follow task adjustment to balance the load later on that enriches the overhead of context switching of tasks among processors. Context switching efforts not only includes the efforts for changing process address space, but position in ready queue is also affected. The work projected in this desertion performs load stability with priori information about processor utilization, based on this metric value processor space is partitioned among different categories. Depending on the load status, processors are categorized and an appropriate set out of those is identified that act as buddy for others and handles incoming queue. In other words stress free “buddy set” handles incoming job queue in place of their “stress underneath buddy set” processors so as to eliminate the pains of context switching and tasks adjustments after the tasks allocation.},

Users learn increasingly on the go and with multiple devices, instead of being tied to a fixed workstation. However, there is a lack of research how the usage of mobile devices influences the learning behavior and outcome in MOOCs. Thus, this paper presents a first quantitative study to examine this question. To enable a statistical analysis, a proof-of-concept implementation outline is presented, which enhances the Learning Analytics capabilities of the openHPI MOOC platform with contextual data to process various learning behavior metrics. Based on an analysis of four courses, it was found that users who additionally learnt with mobile applications showed a higher engagement with the learning material and completed the course more often. Nevertheless, the reasoning must be addressed with qualitative analyses in future, to better support their learning process and success on mobile and stationary devices.},

abstract={In the perspective of growing demand for research accountability, every university is making it an objective to achieve optimum performance in terms of research and development. Successful completion of research depends on the kind of supervision received by students from their supervisors. As students' satisfaction directly affects the quality of research at the university level, there is an urgent need of an explicit system that evaluates students' satisfaction with their supervisors. This paper aims to examine the experiences and challenges of post graduate research students with their supervisors. For this, data were collected through face-to-face interviews and a questionnaire aimed at recording response from 100 post graduate students of a private university in north India. From the study we identified relevant parameters like supervisor's expertise, active listening, availability and self seeking behavior etc. As these parameters are imprecise and difficult to measure directly, these can be expressed in fuzzy context. A fuzzy based approach is used to propose a system that measures the overall student's satisfaction.},

abstract={The new innovation in technology has enhanced online educating, for instance, virtual laboratories are progressively used to teach engineering laboratory activities. Technologies like virtual and augmented reality have reshaped the virtual learners experience. While a large portion of these endeavors' accentuation the significance of the innovation, few have tried to comprehend the procedures to capture, model and codify the laboratory tutor's knowledge. The absence of robust methods on how to automate laboratory tutor's knowledge to teaching and monitoring practical task on virtual platform has influenced the engineering distance learning outcomes. Subsequently, [1] suggest there is a need to investigate further on the best way to capture the laboratory tutor's knowledge, which is essential for teaching and assessing the practical skill of the engineering distance learners through current virtual and augmented reality technologies. In this study, we propose a Knowledge Based Educational (KBEd) framework that facilitates automating on-campus tutors' knowledge into augmented reality (AR) technology. Our study investigates the benefits of using artificial intelligent (AI) and augmented reality (AR) environment in teaching and assessing engineering practical skills. Further the study determined the usefulness of the proposed system by evaluating through first year engineering students with no prior experience of welding. The study results demonstrate that students who learned through proposed AI tutor in the AR environment effectively picked up the practical skills proportional to those in the genuine lab condition who learned with the real laboratory tutor.},

abstract={We propose a preferential theme matrix for selecting a problem in carrying out the minor project for 6th semester Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) students. The matrix comprises of emerging technologies, research areas and the application domains as the parameters. It included Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Mobility and Web Technology as emerging technologies. The focused research areas were on big data & analytics and image processing. The application domains were focused on social relevance such as environment monitoring, health care, safety and security, agriculture. And an additional open choice (others) was mentioned which gave an opportunity for students to explore other new technologies and research areas. Broadly the phases of conducting minor project are classified as team formation, problem identification/selection and project execution which in turn has several sub phases. In team formation students were given freedom to choose their partners with a team size of 4/5 within the same division. This phase was analyzed with respect to Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) grades of team members, which showed a good distribution of grades within the teams and across the entire teams. In problem identification the teams discussed about theme matrix with the assigned guides and presented the project synopsis to the evaluators. After these phases the project execution which in turn included requirement specifications, design, implementation, testing and deployment. To meet some of the pre-requisites for carrying out the projects, workshops on IoT, Cloud computing and open source design tools were organized. For promoting self learning in students, MOOC on the relevant technologies of their projects was introduced as part of minor project. The Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE) of minor project focused on the processes of software engineering and Semester End Exam (SEE) was focused on product/prototype development, technical skills and external recognition. The entire process of conducting minor project met the expected goals with five prizes in SRISHTI state level project exhibition 2016 and five projects accepted for E-poster presentation in international conference.},

abstract={Self-study is realized as a tool for lifelong learning. In order to improve the professional skills of budding engineer, self-study is a component of teaching learning process which helps teacher to monitors the materialization of student activity. The skills that can largely be developed by self-study are communication, critical thinking and practicing modern tools. Activities assigned to the students are (1) Assigning literature to read and apply in their laboratory experimental understanding, (2) read, comprehend and understand the advances in the corresponding field, (3) to demonstrate the concepts taught in class by an experiment (4) get trained and use modern tools for problem solving. The attainments of specific outcomes defined by NBA are designed in such way that it brings desirable change in the student way of learning. Self-study aids the process by measuring various technical and non-technical learning outcomes of student learning. It provides opportunities for students to learn or refine their knowledge of technical concepts traditionally taught in a classroom as well as concepts that are difficult to teach in a classroom setting. Further, it reveals the combination of both teacher-centered and student-centered teaching methods which involves student's activity, gaining and sharing knowledge among the peers. This paper discusses the design, development, implementation of self-study module in the core course of heat transfer in one of the engineering curriculum of BMSCE. It encompasses in-detail discussion on framing of course outcomes, evaluation of different self-study component with rubrics, mapping of CO to PO, improved program outcomes attainment obtained for two consecutive student batches compared with traditional course. The method utilizes data obtained from student marks in internal tests as a means of continuous internal evaluation. This paper discuss the mode of evaluation of selfstudy component, and reasons for the enhanced attainment of CO, PO and hence PSO. The practice of self-study will pave a framework for encompassing cognitive and psychomotor learning outcomes of engineering curriculum.},

year={2018},
volume={},

pages={90-97},
abstract={The popularization of online chatrooms facilitates students to discuss, question and answer based on their learning content. The chat text reflects students' learning concerns, learning progress, learning enthusiasm and so on, which has important reference and analysis value. But the previous studies on students' chat text were mainly to explore the participation behavior and interaction patterns, while less attention was paid to the dynamic process of students' learning. Meanwhile, the existing technology lacked effective analysis methods for the highly variable and multi-topic commingled chat text. Therefore, this paper proposes the Multi-topic Analysis by Extraction and Combination (MtAEC) architecture. On one hand, MtAEC locks the questioner and respondent in the chat, tracks and collects their text, and calculates the text similarity to verify whether the lock result is correct. This method confirms the role of the questioner and the respondent in the chat. On the other hand, to solve the problem of topic analysis in the multi-topic commingled chat text, MtAEC points the parent pointer to the interrogative sentence, and traverses down the child pointer to search the answer. In addition, this paper analyzes the topic of the students' chat and visualizes the experimental results in the form of charts based on the group chat text of a real course. Then, we summarize the students' learning concerns, learning progress and learning enthusiasm, which are helpful for teachers to better understand the dynamic changes of the students' learning process.},

abstract={Computers are the leading technology of the 21st century. Programming, the development of software is thus a fundamental activity in which many people are engaged worldwide. Therefore programming courses are included as a part of the curriculum. In these courses, students are primarily introduced to language features. Traditionally, the students practice by applying the acquired knowledge to solve some logically straightforward problems giving less scope for the programming skills. This paper focuses on application of coding standards, coding techniques, debugging, code review, refactoring, code optimization, test driven programming and pair programming based learning to master not only programming language features, but also an integrated approach to gain problem solving and programming skills. The subject is introduced as a first year course where the students are without any or with smaller amount of background or experience in computer programming. Taking this into consideration, activities like programming were designed. These activities enhanced the learning ability, problem solving skills programming skills and debugging skills.},

abstract={In recent years an engineer or technocrat graduated from any country is expected to provide his/her services to any location of the globe for the betterment of mankind. In this respect it has become necessary that an engineering graduate possesses a set of skills which encompass technical knowledge, practical skills and right attitude. Every educational program defines its program educational objectives (PEOs) and program outcomes (POs)/course outcomes (COs) which spell out the capabilities that a graduated and graduating engineer should have respectively. In this regard, an Outcome Based Learning (OBL) has become an accepted philosophy in technical educational institutes. This paper discusses the basics of OBL and presents a case study carried out for one of the courses of ETC program for the attainment of desired POs through spelled out COs. The study clearly indicates that a focused teaching-learning process and an appropriate assessment has led to attainment of expected POs to a level of more than 70%.},

abstract={Mobile applications for MOOCs (Massive Open On-line Courses) offer the possibility to download learning material to enable network independent learning sessions. The management of downloaded content on mobile devices is a manual process for the learner, which has the potential for automation. This includes the deletion of learning material that is likely to be no longer consumed. In this paper, a metric was defined to quantify learners’ references to previous videos based on the order in which the videos were viewed. In an observational study involving three MOOCs in the field of computer science and IT systems engineering, learners referred to previous video content only a single time on average. Outliers made use of earlier content up to 44 times during a course. Referenced videos belonged in most cases to the current or previous course section. The learners referred more often to previous videos during the course period compared to when participating in self-paced mode, while learners who earned a record of achievement referred to previous videos significantly more frequently than those who did not.},

Also, inclusion and integration of diverse groups of students can be promoted using these tools. Today we can find many tools for teaching robotics. This kind of tools allow us to promote innovation and motivation of students. In this way, students will be able to work during the learning process in an innovative and motivating way. Since it is increasingly common to find robots in our daily lives, it is important to integrate robots into education as well. There are already cooking robots, autonomous cars, vacuum cleaner robots in houses and gardens, or prostheses.

Involving students in the creation of a MOOC has the potential to lead to a more learner-centered MOOC while also providing students with the opportunity to gain skills. This exploratory case study evaluates that potential. We analyze the learning gains of the students, the MOOC they created (the product), and our own support during the development process. Analysis shows that the MOOC had a similar quality to our other MOOCs. Videos and assignments were more creative than usual, but were not created with a much more learner-centered focus. The students gained valuable skills while making the MOOC, such as leadership skills and video presenting skills. The support from university staff was seen as very valuable, but could have been expanded to truly elevate the quality of the content. We end this paper with some practical recommendations for other teams wishing to help students create a MOOC.},

abstract={Although the massive and open nature of MOOCs necessitates more technology support for instructors, existing prediction research has been barely capable of offering real-world solutions. One critical case where MOOC instructors could benefit from real-time technological support is the design of collaborative activities, in particular group formation. In this regard, this research work investigated the use of in-situ learning technique to produce useful and actionable information that could assist instructors in group formation while the course continues. Focusing on a particular MOOC context, a predictive model was created to compute the probability that students would participate in group discussions or not. Using these probability scores, actual group behavior was also predicted for three cases: at least 2, 3 or 4 different students would post in group discussions. According to the results, the model was able to accurately predict individual student behavior as well as group behavior before the actual collaborative activity had taken place, suggesting its potential for real-time use. Future research involves the exploration of other approaches for creating actionable predictions and the application of the predictions in practice in an ongoing MOOC.},

abstract={This work illustrates the use of Design of Experiments (DOE) as an experiential learning in Electrical Machines laboratory. DOE is a systematic method to determine the relationship between factors affecting a process and the output of that process. This information is needed to manage process inputs in order to optimize the output. The objective of this work is to provide an exposure to students on experimentation and simulation environment as a part of structured enquiry problem in the course. A common problem statement was given to the class of eighty students. A batch of five students worked as a team in order to accomplish the task. The problem statement focused on developing the second order response surface methodology based model to predict the speed of a motor by conducting DOE with two control factors and three levels each. Sixteen teams were given common problem statement with varied ranges of control factors. Full Factorial Design (FFD) was selected as a suitable design of experimental layout plan. Each team conducted nine trails for two control factors and three levels. To further validate the model, nine additional experiments with random control factors have been carried out to test the accuracy of the model. Students were introduced to open source simulation tool which was used to predict the response. As per the estimate of laboratory schedule for solving structured enquiry problem, the students were assessed in accordance with the rubrics published well in advance. The competencies addressed for activity are problem analysis, ability to design experiments, individual and team work, simulation. The analysis was concentrated on deviation of predicted and actual measured values of motor speed, regression, and variation of output response with respect to two control factors. This activity helped the students to analyze the results for the proposed problem. As per the assessment, the attainment of the competencies - problem analysis, experimental design planning, individual and team work is around 65.6%, 90.5% and 84.2% respectively. However there is scope for improvement in area of coding as the attainment is comparatively low with 72.5%. As per the students' feedback, their learning is enhanced after having undergone this activity in comparison with classroom learning.},

abstract={Understanding the Learner requirements is an important aspect of any learning environment as it helps to recommend the LOs in a more personalized manner. With the growing demand for MOOCs offered by coursera, edx, etc. the learner information plays a vital role in understanding the extent to which the learners can gain out of such courses. The Learning Management Systems (LMS) across the web uses the explicit (rating, performance, etc.) and implicit feedback (LOs used) obtained through interaction with the learners to derive such information. As the requirements of the learners varies with the individual's interest and learning background, a common approach for recommending LOs may not cater the needs of all the learners. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes reinforcement learning based algorithm to analyze the learner information (derived from both implicit and explicit feedback) and generate the knowledge on the learner's requirements and capabilities inside a specific learning context. The reinforcement learning system (RILS) implemented as a part of this work utilizes the knowledge thus generated in order to recommend the appropriate LOs for the learners. The results have highlighted that the knowledge derived from the learning information analysis proved to effective in generating personalized recommendation policies that can cater the context specific requirements of the learners.},

abstract={This paper presents the innovative method of laboratory learning in Electronic engineering at Government Polytechnic Nagpur and Government Polytechnic Gondia. Students were motivated to purchase their own electronic Mini-Lab (EML) components. They designed simple yet fascinating projects using EML. Students did all the development activities individually. They helped each other and demonstrated collectively. In the process, they learned many aspects of engineering. This will make them skilled engineers. This provides tremendous benefits in teaching learning process. It also boosted the interest, confidence of students. Incorporating active/ cooperative learning into traditional instruction can be a useful pedagogical tool to help students to perform practical and project work. This concept is remarkably simple and cost effective but extremely beneficial to teaching learning process.},

abstract={In the recent years the concept of distant learning and online courses has gained great popularity. MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) is the new trend on the Internet and has rapidly gained much popularity. MOOC allows learners from all over the world to learn in a connected way and in unprecedented scale. MOOC can prove to be a great helping hand in a country like India with more than five thousand engineering colleges [1]. These are gaining huge attention from students all over the globe. These MOOC are acting as a revolution in the field of education. Collective learning and massive involvement of individuals are the key features that make MOOC impactful. Offering of such courses by elite universities lure the individuals to get registered for these courses. This paper aims to propose a model for Indian education system using BLMM [15] as a base for the improvement. Thus it will first describe the general scenario of MOOCs in India and later will propose three level implementation models for Indian education system.},

abstract={A "multi-module" project involves more than onesubcomponent, with possible dependencies between components. An automotive electronics, a core course taught for the studentsof circuit branches is mainly application oriented involvingsystem level concepts. The course was introduced to cater to theneeds of automotive industries. The concepts of entire course canbe divided into five main domains, power train, safety systems, body, driver assistance and infotainment systems. Accordingly tocomplement the learning it was decided to introduce an extendedactivity in the form of course projects wherein the theme was todevelop electronic control units (ECUs) for every domain. AnECU of an automotive has multiple functionalities, eachrepresenting a sub-module of a bigger system. The integration ofsub-modules to realize a specific ECU was major objective of theactivity. The sub-module development involves modeling, hardware/software development and communication protocolimplantation. To impart the industry like working cultureamongst students, every sub-module belonging to specific ECUwas assigned to the students of different department. Submodules were developed independently by specialized dedicatedteam of a particular department and were integrated todemonstrate a final ECU by different department teams. ThePrototype models with an option of testing on a test vehicle werethe results of this activity.

abstract={Life-long learning is necessary for all professions because the technologies, tools and skills required for success over the course of a career expand and change. Professionals in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields face particular challenges as new multi-disciplinary methods, e.g. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, mature to replace those learned in undergraduate or graduate programs. Traditionally, industry, professional societies and university programs have provided professional development. While these provide opportunities to develop deeper understanding in STEM specialties and stay current with new techniques, the constraints on formal classes and workshops preclude the possibility of Just-In-Time Mastery Learning, particularly for new domains.The MIT Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center (LLSC) and MIT Supercloud teams have developed online course offerings specifically designed to provide a way for adult learners to build their own educational path based on their immediate needs, problems and schedules. To satisfy adult learners, the courses are formulated as a series of challenges and strategies. Using this perspective, the courses incorporate targeted theory supported by hands-on practice. The focus of this paper is the design of Mastery, Just-in-Time MOOC courses that address the full space of hands-on learning requirements, from digital to analog. The discussion centers on the design of project-based exercises for professional technical education courses. The case studies highlight examples from courses that incorporate practice ranging from the construction of a small radar used for real world data collection and processing to the development of high performance computing applications.},

abstract={There is a need to prepare engineering students for the future world to be good engineers, to be a good engineer the theoretical background of the curriculum that they go through is not sufficient they need to practice what they have understood. In order for students to practice as engineers, they need to have exposure to a number of projects that offer complex problems, along with the uncertainty of factors that influence such problems. In this view Electronic instrumentation program is divided into two verticals embedded system and process automation to provide domain specific Knowledge to students and courses are designed to fit into these domains to satisfy current industrial needs. To provide more hands on experience curriculum and related activities are planned at three different levels. At first level(Second year) along with laboratory course, activities are planned and defined as course projects which augments theoretical concepts and also aids in interconnecting various courses for integrated approach, these activities strengthen the conceptual knowledge of students. Next level (Third year) theme based Mini and Minor projects are planned, themes are decided based on Subject learnt in previous semester and recent technological developments. These activities provide a platform to realize applications belonging to a specific theme. In the final level capstone projects are grouped into Industry projects, product development and research oriented projects. Students are allowed to extend their academic experience into areas of personal interest, working with new ideas, issues, organizations, and individuals. These activities helped students to develop their communication, interpersonal, project management, and design skills. It also provides students with an understanding of the economic, financial, legal, and regulatory aspects of the design, development, and commercialization of the technology with these activities carried out throughout the year we are able to achieve better quality in paper publications, winning awards in prestigious project competitions conducted by industries and academia along with improvement in placements, Semester End Examination and addressing professional and technical outcomes of ABET.},

The ontological engineering methodology is widely used in many domains of computer and information science, cooperative information systems, intelligent information integration, information retrieval and extraction, knowledge representation, and database management systems. In this paper we have attempted to create a web-based tool named Knowledge Analyzer for teaching disabled students. The main focus is to impart knowledge of Java in the form of videos and tutorials. There is evaluation module that provides the quiz to learner to evaluate and self-analyze their knowledge. The instructor also provides the guidance on the basis of the marks. The Knowledge Analyzer is evaluated on the basis of feedback provided by the students. There feedback is provided by the student after using the Knowledge Analyzer. The most of the students liked the module and some students suggested some enhancements in the Knowledge Analyzer.},

Inspite of all the excitement and hype surrounding the MOOC phenomenon a number of doubts also exist parallel to the hype. In India the MOOC concept is still to catch on in the education scene with a number of academicians expressing their doubts over whether it will be a success or not. Research in MOOC technology is also becoming a potentially new area in education technology. However, many people are still unaware of the various aspects of MOOC technology. This paper is an eye opener that will describe the history, the various terminologies and technologies associated with the MOOC technology. We will outline the essential steps that have to be taken care of before developing a MOOC. The challenges and issues that are currently facing this new technology are discussed.

abstract={Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) have become popular in various regions of the world through the years. Since 2008, this phenomenon has received plenty of attention from higher education and universities across countries began to produce these courses. The countries of Europe and the United States are the world’s leading producers of MOOCs and research studies reporting on this topic. This previous research has focused on (1) analysing data from global providers such as edX, Coursera or FutureLearn; (2) describing learners’ characteristics from a small sample of courses in these regions; and (3) offering overviews of courses and platforms. However, research in other regions such as Latin America or Africa are very scarce. As a consequence, little is known about local initiatives in Latin America region, and about the needs and characteristics of its learners. Moreover, this has generated an unequal and biased perspective of what we know today about MOOC learners. To close this inequality gap, this work, presents a cross-platform exploratory study in Latin America, using data from more than three million learners and seven different MOOC providers to generate a joint comparable analysis about students’ characteristics in this region with others regions in the world. Preliminary results report on the differences and similarities of trends based on level of education, age, gender of students, their level of activity and performance of learners in Latin America through the different providers of MOOCs. These results help us understand the MOOC ecosystem in Latin America and report results to the entire community, while at the same time calling for more large-scale studies between researchers and institutions.},

abstract={Designing is a prominent process in engineering field to build prototype model of a system. In Software Engineering approach, Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) models a system as a group of interacting objects. The aim of OOAD is to understand the problem utterly and all its inferences for its potential users. It is one of the designing courses that the students are learning in their curriculum and it is also used throughout the software development life cycle. Since OOAD has involved completely theoretical concepts and the tutor may face difficulty while teaching. The main issues to understand the course by students are recognizing the objects, analyzing and mapping objects to the real world. These issues provoked the authors to use pioneer approaches to teach effectively this course. This paper discusses few pedagogical tools to teach the course efficiently for Post Graduate (PG) students. Since OOAD course is also associated with laboratory, different open-ended problem statements are given for each student to carry out the experiments using Rational Rose tool. The group of two students is assigned to learn an open source tool to design a given application. Some of the open source tools learnt by the students are Pace Star, E-draw, UMLet, AgroUML, Astah etc. Each student have selected different concepts of OOAD to do the survey of conference/journal papers and presented the work as a part of Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE). These novel methods improved analysis, design, implementation and learning ability of OOAD concepts. These activities enhanced their confidence level, communication and presentation skills.},

abstract={MOOCs and SPOCs have been key elements in accelerating the digital transformation of many higher education institutions. The fact that higher education institutions can offer online courses, such as MOOCs or SPOCs, facilitates also the virtual mobility of students so that a student enrolled in one university can take online courses from other universities at the same time. This has the great advantage that students can take exams at their home university with local invigilation, in this way solving one of the problems with MOOCs. Nevertheless, there are numerous aspects that should be considered when implementing virtual mobility. These aspects affect several stakeholders besides students: teaching staff, teaching support services, IT services, etc. This paper discusses nine of these key aspects: 1) course selection, 2) teaching, 3) lab, 4) office hours, 5) communication, 6) documentation, 7) exam, 8) transcripts, and 9) campus life. For each of these nine aspects the who (students' identity), the what (contents) and the how (tools) are analyzed, based on the experience gained in the European Virtual exchange (EVE) project, and proposing new improvements for these aspects.},

abstract={Online Education has proven that can provide rich learning environments and stimulating experiences. However, the inherent physical distance in online education/learning complicates the learning process in some educational areas. This is the case of subjects related to technical aspects, in which the knowledge cannot be attained only through ideal models. Traditionally, this disadvantage has been alleviated by the substitution of real labs by simulators, however, simulators still obey a model. More recently, remote labs-real instruments and equipment, performing experiments in real environments, which are controllable remotely-grant the opportunity to provide real labs in online courses. The availability-both, temporal (24/7) and geographical-is the key feature in which remote laboratories lie. This aspect makes remote lab an ideal tool for online education/learning and, in most cases, the unique way to provide a contact with real devices in a 100% online educational model. This is nevertheless false in courses in which scalability is a requirement. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) inherit the advantages and disadvantages of online education/learning approach. However, scalability is a must in MOOCs and remote labs, as any other real system, have physical limitations. In this paper, we will show the integration of a remote lab in a MOOC and how the physical limitations of a real environment have been overcome.},

pages={47-53},
abstract={Higher-order thinking, known as higher order thinking skills (HOTS), is a conception of education reorganization based on learning taxonomy. Skills involving analysis, evaluation and synthesis are considered to be of higher order, requiring diverse learning and teaching methods than the customary learning of facts and concepts. HOTS involves the learning of complex judgmental skills such as critical thinking and problem solving. They are activated when individuals encounter unfamiliar problems, uncertainties, questions, or dilemmas. Successful application of the skills results in justifications, decisions, performances, and products that are valid within the context of existing knowledge that encourages continued growth in other intellectual skills. The major difficulty in attaining HOTS among engineering students is that we still pursue the traditional approach of teacher-centered classroom where the teacher is an active transmitter and the students are passive recipients. To achieve HOTS among engineering students we establish an Active Learning Environment (ALE) with the effective usage of Information and communication technologies (ICT). Active learning is embodied in a learning environment where the teachers and students are actively engaged with the content through discussions, problem-solving, critical thinking, or a multitude of activities that encourage interaction among learners, instructors and the material. Supporting to active learning, the ICT usage lends itself to more student-centered learning. This paper demonstrates the strategies to achieve HOTS through various ALE strategies like Role Play, Jigsaw, Brainstorming, debate, Mind map etc for Concept Understanding and Group assignments, combined mini projects, Discussion on Topics, Quiz, and Puzzles for Concept Applying. We have applied various learning strategies and assessed the student outcomes. HOTS is achieved by developing applications or products, with improved inter personal skills and lifelong learning skills. The evidence for the effectiveness of ALE among engineering students is showed by great improvement in their academic result, placement record and research interests},

abstract={Present day's amount of computational requirements has shifted the processing of data from the regular way to parallel way of computation. Pipelined processors, array processors can be employed to construct design of parallel hardware. These systems constructed can be further extended with the help of scalar and super scalar systems. We provide an efficient way of implementing Winograd's variant of Strassen's matrix multiplication on parallel systems by making use of RMI(Remote Method Invocation ) which provides us distributed object oriented programming, multithreading programming. Multithreading approach helps a lot in concurrent, dynamic and asynchronous programming. In this paper clusters have been made from very basic hardware systems which are connected on local area network using switch and a master system connected to this switch uses three NIC. The facility of Winograd's variant of Strassen's method to run in divide and conquer approach is the basic fact around which whole analysis has been performed. Actual partitioning (AP) of a given matrix into sub matrix according to cluster size and at each system logical partitioning (LP) of each sub matrix into size 2×2 has been performed which on a whole covers the aspect of SIMD based model. The parallel computing metrics like speed up, efficiency, excessive parallel overhead proves RMI as a better approach for distributed computing as RMI provides look and feel like a user is working on local machine as not much overheads are being there in order to convert a non-distributed application to the distributed one.},

abstract={Massive Open Online Courses have been looked at both as disruptive innovation as well as the biggest experiment in education in recent times. 15 Million learners have turned to MOOCs as in 2014 and Indians constitute the second largest share of the MOOC user base. This paper attempts to understand some of the essential characteristics that distinguish a MOOC user from a non-user in India. A proprietary survey for understanding MOOC consumers has been used to draw insights on demographics of potential MOOC users including age, occupation, gender, educational backgrounds as well as some salient aspects of their personality, learning styles and life goals. Three logistic regression models have been tested. The first model investigates the impact of background demographic variables and internet skills of respondents on the choice to enroll in at least one MOOC course. The second model includes key personality traits that are hypothesized to influence the user adoption of MOOCs and the full modeladdsvariables pertaining to learning styles, learning environment and life goals. Those with better internet skills and an existing preference for learning through videos were seen to be significantly more likely to adopt MOOCs. Personality traits aligned with an openness to try new things were seen to influence the adoption decision but the learning styles and learning environment did not differentiate users from non-users. The results also indicate a significant influence of gender and age.},

abstract={The University of South Africa (UNISA) is a mega Open Distance Learning (ODL) institution in Africa. UNISA is considering advocating totally online tuition in the near future. Currently, e-learning (electronic learning), is used for online teaching. However, e-learning is only one component of a conglomerate of components that must be taken cognisance of when designing an integrated online teaching framework for the university. The predominant role of e-learning cannot be undermined as technology has a very high educational contribution, but often technology is viewed as the sole driver to ensure that learning outcomes are achieved. Adopting an integrated robust best practices framework to online teaching practices based on multiple components for academics is far more important than being merely technically competent. However, teaching is not the sole mandate of UNISA. The university has a tripartite mission to deliver quality tuition, research and community engagement. This paper proposes an integrated best practices framework to online teaching, research and community engagement within an ODL sphere. Integration is achieved by consolidating the current teaching, research and community engagement practices of the institution within a consolidated best practices framework. The objective of this paper is to present a standard best practices framework which can be applied across the university, which academics can use in the development of new online practices regarding tuition, research and community engagement or as a means of evaluating or enhancing existing practices.},

abstract={Team-based learning (TBL) is a form of student-centered active learning which will help to develop various professional skills, problem solving, interpersonal team skills, and self-directed independent learning. The success of TBL approach depends on its design comprising Team formation, Project identification and distribution, monitoring the progress, maintaining open discussion in every phase and peer evaluation. This paper presents the case study TBL design done for minor project course. First step, the team formation plays a very important role in projects. Therefore the teams are formed based on the complementary skills of the student and ensuring that each team has an expert member in every identified skill. The next step is project distribution, while distributing the project the team strength is calculated and accordingly the problem statements are assigned. Also to increase the motivation and learning in the team, open discussions are held where each team can review and critic other teams work in every phase. The last part in the TBL is assessment and evaluation, which is incomplete without including peer evaluation. Although the Team work is evaluated by the instructor, the individual evaluation is done by both instructor as well as peer students within the team. This TBL design has improved the team's performance and each individual is able to work better in a team. Here students could successfully build and lunch mobile app as a product. The paper gives results of various TBL components. It concludes with challenges faced in this case study for further research.},

abstract={In the field of Computer Science and Engineering, the Algorithms course is considered very important for not only it forms the basis for several concepts but also, its in-depth understanding can help one solve many new and challenging problems in an efficient manner. Whether a student pursues his career in academia or industry, depth of his understanding in Algorithms is certainly tested during competitive exams directly or indirectly. In this paper, we discuss a case study of using an innovative approach based on randomized algorithms and some statistics in teaching Algorithms to engineering students, with aim to provide students a better individual learning experience. The approach has wider applicability but here it is practiced in relation to sorting algorithms. In this paper, we also discuss the student's feedback that we collected after completion of the course. It was observed that students were very appreciative of this novel approach used, and the majority of students found that it helped them in getting more clarity and deeper understanding of sorting algorithms.},

abstract={Faculty members are the key human resource for an engineering institution. The quality of the faculty members decides the success of engineering education to a large extent and hence their development is very vital for the sustained growth of an institution. An all-round or holistic development of faculty members to cater to the needs of future is imperative as the challenges faced and responsibilities to be shouldered by them in today's engineering education environment is very wide and diverse in nature. It is necessary that faculty members given training with suitable focus and emphasis to attain academic effectiveness, accelerate growth and to achieve synergy at the institutional level. Keeping in mind the above facts, a three tier approach for the development of faculty members of engineering colleges to equip them with the necessary knowledge and skill sets is proposed. The model will be administered over a period of time at various levels giving due emphasis for professionalism. The approach involves multiple modules, continuous learning, practicing, sharing of experiences, reflecting on practices and assessment at all stages.},

abstract={Although Internet promises to overcome barriers, itself represents a challenge when it is applied to the educational field, since at this early stage, yet there is a lack of clear precedents on how to use technological benefits in education. A punctual case is the vast number of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) that have appeared, forcing to rise a question: What is the better methodology to deploy a MOOC? The answer is given from different standpoints, but blended teaching seems to be a promissory solution. We propose here a methodological scheme based on blended teaching to implement a MOOC deployed with an OpenEdx platform. An initial application of the methodology over the undergraduate course “physics of electricity and magnetism” serves to illustrate the benefits of a partial transition from traditional teaching model in the short time. Our experience shows that this methodology is promissory and should be further developed.},

abstract={Entrepreneurship is a key driver of economic growth of a country. However, concerns on uncertainty associated with entrepreneurship drive parents to motivate children during their formative days to aspire for permanent jobs and they grow with that aspiration. Many have provided empirical evidences supporting motivational effect of entrepreneurial education even though formal entrepreneurship education is yet to gain traction in emerging economy, proliferation of which may entail prohibitively huge resources. MOOCs can obviate the need for infrastructure and other resources and can promote entrepreneurial education to a large audience of heterogeneous mix. We argue that MOOCs bring enormous advantages in terms of cost, flexibility of time, breaking geographical boundary, removing entry barrier and promoting entrepreneurial education to a large pool of students and professionals. It can bring about revolutionary change in the mind-set of a generation of youth motivating them to promote entrepreneurial ventures. MOOCs can also play a significant role in a new and fast evolving corporate strategic process of `corporate entrepreneurship' by offering flexible learning opportunity to related employees. Using data from various developed and emerging world we show in this paper that entrepreneurship education is essential for economic growth and quality of life of people of a nation. We also highlight some of the challenges in open teaching and outline the possible contents of such education.},

The office automation MOOC assessment period corresponds to 2019-2t. The results showed that students don’t see the videos, they prefer to accomplish the activities in the MOOC to success phase one of the assessment; students know about general topics but don’t know about specific tools or applications, being Word application the less understood. Students mastered Excel more than PowerPoint. Additionally, the analysis of the activities of the MOOC in phase one, brought more comprehension of what happened in the phase three (face to face exam).},

abstract={User experience design is all about making a product by understanding its users and enables user to use a product easily. UX design is part of current industry standards which can be started along with requirement phase. Undergraduate students build products in project courses. Such courses include Software Life Cycle phases like Requirement gathering/ analysis, Design, Implementation and Testing but not UX design. Thus best of the project fail to generate a product that is usable. This paper presents a case study of minor project course which incorporated UX design in building mobile apps. UX is new technology and little known to instructors at colleges. So students were instructed to learn UX from MOOC on 'UX Design for Mobile Developer's', hosted by Udacity. Also, a workshop by industry expert in UX was conducted. The UX activities specified by MOOC were included as part course assessments. Through the UX design, students identified 3 to 4 user/ mobile device requirements and incorporated them in the implementation. The weightage of marks for UX design is 24%, which increased Design phase weightage to 30%. Finally students were able to launch product, 'KLE Tech STUDio' mobile-app. Attainment of design phase, UX, activities specified by MOOC, implementations are 7.2, 7.82, 6.8 and 7.5 respectively on the scale of 10. Further UX design can be included as part of Software Engineering course. Also, UX design can be tailored to any project course depending on the product being developed.},

abstract={MOOCs (massive open online courses) often use comprehensive exams and homework problem sets to assess students in their overall understanding of course material. The grades students receive on these tests and assignments determine whether they complete or become certified in course material. However, beyond receiving a certification, how do grades impact the learning behavior in students? Do students who receive poor grades actively change their overall activity to improve their grades? To better understand the impact of grades, we observe overall student activity on two MITx MOOCs for certified students and students who continuously participate in MOOC assignments. We use click stream data to compile the overall activity of a student and we use points earned divided by total possible points to calculate the students' grades. We observe that students with the highest levels of activity have some of the highest grades. We also observe that the difference in activity before and after the finalization of a grade (delta-activity) have greater variation as grade increases. Finally, we observe very little changes in grades (delta-grade) for certified students when visualized against delta-activity and that continuously participating students have greater grade changes compared to certified students.},

SLs are mainly used for gluing applications and type less approach has made them as higher level programming languages. In this paper authors wish to convey their experience in designing curriculum and conducting the SLs laboratory course. A novel classification is presented to classify a large set of SLs, based on the utility of SLs. Basic scripts, Text processing Scripts, Glue languages, GUI scripting and Application specific languages categories are part of this nomenclature. In Outcome Based Education (OBE), assessment is one of the main parameters to check the learnability of the students. So OBE curriculum design inspire the authors to include assessment strategy step in the curriculum design. The Python scripting language is introduced for the first time in SLs laboratory by the authors to improve the learnability. They have also proposed pedagogical activities like multiple assignments, test plan writing, course project and multimedia book reading. The analysis of activities shows that 83% of students have passed with good grades and no failures in the course.},

abstract={Due to their openness and low barriers to enroll, most Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) offer free access to knowledge for almost everyone. This attracts a large number of learners, each with their own individual intentions and motivations to join a course. However, personal support and guidance can almost never be provided at this scale. All learners have to follow the same usually weekly structured content and the learning success is only measured by the achievement of a certificate. To overcome this one-size-fits-all approach with technical means, we introduced a tool for Personalized Learning Objectives. This enables learners to achieve more individual objectives in courses, follow different learning paths, and link their motivations and intentions to the definition of learning success. Previous studies have already examined, among other aspects, the usefulness, acceptance, and achievement rates of learning objectives in MOOCs. In this complimentary research, the satisfaction of students with and without a selected learning objective is compared in a course on topics from the field of Design Thinking.},

The traditional way of using pre-post test scores and learners' feedback is not much helpful in assessing the online learning behavior. In the proposed research work, a learner's behavior prediction model is to be built using hybrid deep learning techniques. For this model building, various information such as facial expressions, time series Electroencephalography (EEG) data, clinical parameters like pulse rate, blood pressure, and skin temperature are acquired directly from the learner through sensors and other general information namely age, course, gender, location are included. Using this data collection, a hybrid model using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) is to be built and validated in real time for predicting the cognitive ability of a learner.},

Despite its prevalence, many primary school teachers and educators in India are unaware of dyslexia. Consequently, many students struggle through school without appropriate support. To facilitate identification of dyslexic students, we designed a screening test and administered it to 135 primary school children studying in Government and private schools in Haripad, a small town in Kerala State, India. The tasks included letter recognition, word recognition, recognition of rhyming words, spelling tests, and handwriting tasks in English and Malayalam (the local language), and assessed phonological awareness, visual processing, rapid naming, and motor skills. The students' answers were analyzed, mistakes were categorized, and possible causes for the mistakes were examined.

abstract={This paper discusses the design of a video blog to enhance the social presence of educators in MOOCs. Social presence is considered to be one of the critical factors in education, and MOOCs are no exception. However, in the most existing MOOCs, educators' social presence is limited due to its predefined, linear course structure, as well as text-based semi-synchronous conversation. Hence, this research proposes a daily video blog, which focuses on presenting: 1) Educators Biography; educators' background and experience in the subject area, 2) Educators Feedback; educators' response to learners' questions raised in the course, and 3) Educators Discussion; educators' debate on the latest trends surrounding the course topicto further augment educators' social presences. This paper studies the computer science course of FutureLearn which was conducted in October 2018 and April 2019. A series of short videos were uploaded per day on YouTube and shared with learners alongside the four weeks course. Through observing educators and learners' behavior, as well as conducting interviews with learners, the findings suggest a positive impact of a video blog on enhancing educators' social presence and further opens up new possibilities and new ways in designing MOOCs.},

This constant and unstoppable revolution is transmuting all areas of our life: social, cultural, personal, labor, economic, training, etc. This new society is characterized by a high generation of knowledge and the constant and fluid processing of information. In this macro-context, the MOOC phenomenon emerged. MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) courses are based on the principles of massive, free access to all materials and resources offered online. This new didactic path can be constituted in an innovative techno-social tendency, especially oriented in the panorama of Higher Education to stimulate university improvement, open opportunities at the same time for education and training or, simply, derive towards a new business model for the universities. In addition to being an entry point for the popularization of science and knowledge, the future possibilities are enormous and are being studied in all their various dimensions. Many initiatives as a result have been developed to implement this new form of education. MOOC Courses and the Future of Higher Education presents the latest research theories and current examples of MOOC courses practices in Higher Education. The chapters represent an extensive assortment of interpretations and practices examples of MOOC courses, across areas as varied as teaching methodologies, instructional innovations, educational technology, etc. This work is structured in three sections, the first one covers the university institution in the knowledge society, the second analyzes the MOOC training proposals, and the third discusses the future role of MOOCs. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • The Virtualization of Teaching in Higher Education • Training and Professional Development at the e-University • Taxonomy of MOOCs • MOOC: Strengths and Weaknesses • MOOCs and the Scientific Community: Challenges and Innovation • MOOC Platforms • Directory of MOOC Resources • MOOC: Reflections of the Future},

abstract={Ad-hoc networks are collection of self-organized, autonomous nodes (routers) and capable to communicate directly with neighbors' node through broadcast packet in within transmission range. Ad hoc network has a primary concern to provide protected communication between mobile nodes. In transmission channel, nodes can be a malicious node and compromise or breaches service, which makes security extremely challenging. Our major focus is to discuss the feasibility of monitoring the nodes of different networks, and analyze it for providing better security. Data mining techniques used to classify for large aggregate data according classification rules and patterns, to detect or identify malicious node. In this paper Idea is based on k-Mediods clustering algorithm to form cluster with high detection rate based on intrusion behavior or normal behavior.},

abstract={Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are a major improvement step for online and distance learning. Although the teaching aspect of most MOOCS are advance and suffice, the assessment part is often considered as ineffective. Many MOOCS are missing the concept of evaluating students regarding the learning objects of the specific MOOC, which is to be expected due to the large number and the heterogony of the participants. Nevertheless, due to the fact that many MOOCs are providing partial didactic credits units at university level, the improvement of their quality is been advised. At this paper a hybrid assessment model is been presented that utilized online formative assessment through a smart adaptive formative assessment system, combined with an optional in person evaluation in test centres. The proposed hybrid assessment model is focused at mathematics, although a similar model could be applied and benefit most of MOOCs.},

abstract={Open pedagogy engages with learners as knowledge creators rather than knowledge consumers. Learners exhibit their learning through acts of knowledge creation. The constructivist learning theory suggests that learners construct knowledge and learn from their experiences and reflections. According to the constructive alignment framework, the acts of instruction consist of four components: educational outcomes, academic resources, instructional activities, and learning assessment. Management of these four components is the core of educational practices in higher education. In the context of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), the pattern of engagement changes according to the pedagogy deployed. This paper seeks to understand the practices of open pedagogy in two MOOCs that were offered in the Indian SWAYAM MOOC platform through the constructive alignment model. Anecdotal analysis shows that the openness in MOOCs can engage learners in a meaningful learning experience and prepare them for the 21st-century workplace.},

abstract={The 21st century has given rise to an economic and social system based on learning and, therefore, on the capacity to create and connect new and existing knowledge through people, rather than on the abundance of content. This change, compared to the industrial model, calls for a serious analysis of the need for flexible, fluid and transversal training in subjects or, rather, in competencies, from different fields. Learning systems have begun to address this challenge with massive open online courses. Nonetheless, MOOCs often replicate classical models of learning. They follow traditional learning paths based on the concept of “cycles”, with analysis of topics within a single subject area. We need to develop learning objects that can be (re)articulated and developed according to the binary logic of decomposition-aggregation, fragmentation-recomposition. In this way, we can propose a sort of multi-skilled knowledge and skills set that is agile and capable of selecting and communicating on different levels, able to deal convincingly with diverse subject areas, and that can be constantly updated. This is the only way for lifelong learning to take place, within a constant process of regeneration and multiplication, rather than through cycles. Digital learning can play a decisive role in responding to this challenge and, in the long term, will be indispensible. It is a model that follows and, in some way, supports or partially replaces the traditional University offering. But, more than that, digital learning provides new “granular” access to knowledge in response to the contingent needs of those people who “have to” access that knowledge.},

pages={300-305},
abstract={The hurdle problem in Cross Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) is the poor performance when compared to monolingual performance in terms of average precision. The main reasons behind the poor performance of CLIR are query term mismatching, multiple representations of query terms and un-translated query terms. In this paper, we are putting our effort to solve the given problem which is discussed in detail. The limitations are needed to be addressed in order to increase the performance of the CLIR system. By analyzing those methods the architecture for English-Hindi CLIR system is proposed. Pre and post query expansion is used to improve the performance of English-Hindi CLIR system using English and Hindi WordNet, Local Expansion using initial query, definition based pre query expansion and keyword ranking. The pre and post query expansion helps to improving the performance of English-Hindi CLIR system and based upon past experiences the proposed approach retrieves more relevant information. All experiments are performed on FIRE 2010 (Forum of Information Retrieval Evaluation) datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed approach gives equal/better performance of English-Hindi CLIR system compared to monolingual performance and also helps in overcoming existing problems and outperforms the existing English-Hindi CLIR system in terms of average precision.},

abstract={Information and communication technology (ICT) is essential as infrastructure in the modern society. High level ICT professionals are strongly required. Universities, ICT industries and ICT qualification bodies are expected to collaborate to build a consistent system for education, training and evaluation to develop such high level ICT professionals. In this paper, we propose a web-based assessment tool named “cresie”. The tool maintains various types of standard requirement data such as those of college level computing curriculum, various ICT qualifications, and ICT task profiles. A student or an IT engineer can upload their self-evaluation data of achievement to cresie and compare the data with the requirement data. He (or she) can also compare the data with other cresie users. All of the evaluation and requirement data are described in terms of the common ICT body of knowledge (ICTBOK) which we have proposed in our previous paper. The system can also be used for curriculum assessment and requirement assessment for recruiting and evaluating IT professionals.},

Intrusion detection system (IDS) is one of the principal components of any information security system. Identification of anomalous activity in computer network is first step in identifying the threat to information system. Our focus is mainly on Genetic algorithm (GA) based anomaly detection technique, as GA is one of the most effective evolutionary techniques for machine learning. In this paper Genetic algorithm is applied for network intrusion detection. Our approach for optimization specifically focusing on false positive rate. Reduction in false positive rate also improves accuracy and performance. The limitation of other techniques of accuracy, false positive rates has been addressed in this paper. Experimental results show the efficient detection rates based on KDD99cup datasets which is a standard dataset for intrusion detection.},

abstract={Project based learning (PBL) in Engineering is an alternate for traditional pedagogy in which the learner will gain knowledge and skills by developing a solution for an authentic problem in a specified duration. Since it can be framed as continuous engaging activity, the number of topics of the course syllabi gets delivered in the process. A case study approach for a course titled `Digital Signal Processing (DSP)' is presented, as an example for PBL. The problem statement chosen for the PBL implementation is to illustrate a novel concept of Smart Headphones using Active Noise Cancellation and speech recognition. The PBL project is designed to address the contemporary issue of speech recognition in multimedia headphone to make it smart at a low cost. The prototype design based on principles of Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is achieved using a processor, TMS320C5416. The sub tasks of this project are correlated to different topics of the course of DSP syllabus. The sub task implementation, evaluation and mapping help to attain the outcomes of the course by means of PBL. The hands on experiments carried out with the DSP processor in implementing the proposed project in stages provide the better and ease of understanding of the course. An evaluation of stage wise implementation as compared to the corresponding evaluation modules of traditional DSP course delivery has been presented.},

abstract={Keeping in mind technological trends and student behaviour, higher educational institutes are adopting major changes in content delivery. The objective is to keep students engaged in the courses that they learn, which in turn would help them perform better academically. This paper describes students' online engagement in terms of their learning, participation and academic performance after teaching a course in a blended learning environment that consisted of teaching using learning management system (LMS), mobile computing systems, projected slides and white-board. It was found that there is a positive correlation between student engagement and the use of LMS. It was also observed that there is a strong positive correlation between the presence of various modules of the LMS in a course and the usage of the LMS by the students from outside the campus. Another finding made by the authors was that the off-campus usage and the on-campus usage of the LMS by the students are strongly correlated to each other. This study can be used by instructors and management of educational institutes to understand the significance of implementing learning management systems in order to provide a blended learning environment to the students.},

Despite intensified advantages and efficiency, people accessing MOOCs from the developing countries (especially India) do not count to a significant number. India being a promising abode of education too offers a prospective area to MOOCs for large scale implementation. But several factors and constraints like low digital literacy and lack of massive digital infrastructure hinder this process of extensive implementation of MOOCs. Even after all the prevalent constraints India leads the developing nations in terms of MOOCs enrollment.

abstract={By design, the computer science curriculum for undergraduate students in the United States does not include enough hands-on courses such as microcontrollers and embedded systems. It is difficult for students, especially the Distance Learners (DL) to appreciate the power of computer science as a problem-solving field without real-world experiments. Furthermore, students in computer science may drop-out or turn away from the field because it does not offer an opportunity for them to communicate with each other during online/traditional labs. In this paper, an active learning project-based approach in online/traditional computer science courses is introduced to make the courses' material more attractive to students from minorities. Students obtain a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world problems. Students will enjoy the challenges they face when developing solutions. This paper studies the impact of hands-on project-based learning using Raspberry Pi on students taking online and face-to-face computer science courses at Old Dominion University.},

But, they suffer from high attrition rate. To utilize the available resources, offered by MOOCS, efficiently, SPOC (Small Private Online Courses) model has emerged. SPOCs combine student centered resource model with traditional instructor centered classroom model of learning. To explore the potential of mobile based active learning technology in a SPOC, we offered a university course as a modified SPOC. We studied the impact of the course on students' learning by conducting surveys and monitoring their progress throughout the course duration. Our results show online resources, specifically videos, can be used successfully to enhance learning in traditional classrooms. Our findings also show that mobile based feedback applications results in better engagement. Our studies also confirm that marks remain the prime motivating factor for students' efforts.},

abstract={It is evident, that the number of qualified teachers is less but the number of students willing to learn new technologies is increasing tremendously. Therefore, it is desired that alternative methods should be adopted to reduce the gap between the required number of qualified teachers and the actually available. As the technology is evolving rapidly, Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) appears to be an imminent concept which allows the students to use the IT infrastructure to learn while sitting at their home or workplace. MOOCs help the students to nurture problem-solving capabilities in them with the help of a plethora of online courses in diverse fields. Learners can choose courses of their interest and acquire a certificate of the same. This paper explores the concept and benefits of MOOCs in today's scenario, its advantages like freedom from geographic boundaries, flexibility, optimal cost, better educational outcomes. Further, this paper highlights challenges and limitations towards implementing MOOCs such as the dearth of infrastructure in developing countries, absence of proper assessment method, invalidity of such courses in conventional degree level programs, lack of practical sessions, and dropout rate. Significant developments in the field of MOOCs are ongoing in India under the banner of Ministry of Human Resource Development's project SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active-Learning for Young Aspiring Minds). Nature Journal survey has shown that India ranked second in the world to access MOOCs services. Indian Institute of Bombay and Indian Institute of Kharagpur started a program called T10KT (Train 10 Thousand (K) Teachers) to conduct large-scale teachers training and E-learning awareness program. This paper wraps up with some other developments implementing MOOCs in India with some pragmatic case studies.},

abstract={Our research group is currently engaged in an enhanced learning environment, within higher education, using Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in combination with Innovation-Based Learning (IBL). Both approaches to learning when arranged correctly, improve students learning and engagement towards the course. When using IBL, one of the main problems that students experience is the selection of their class project. We propose a methodology based on funding opportunity announcements (FOA) to aid in the selection process. Student groups are able to quickly compare and match their skills and interests to market demand as expressed by groups such as NIH or NSF. The students in the class experience a blended approach; they collaborate online and in-class, and they apply knowledge acquired from online content to their main project. In this blended approach, FOAs act as a catalyst to students' learning; it both focuses them at the beginning and motivates them throughout the course. Students in this MOOC-enabled learning ecosystem grow in their intrinsic motivation and engagement. Furthermore, FOAs project selection solves scalability issues when dealing with inter-disciplinary projects and availability of proper experts/mentors for students. This tailored combination improves efficiency and targets project's relevance, which makes it very attractive to higher education administrators.},

abstract={The approach of producing a MOOC on Nuclear Safety Culture within ANNETTE H2020 EURATOM project is an opportunity to accomplish a variety of interesting objectives. In the nuclear sector innovation in education is needed. Facts like the retirement of experienced personnel, the generational gap and the need to capture talented students and professionals is motivating the use of new educational tools and methodologies. In this context MOOCs, and the flexibility of NOOCs offer interesting possibilities. Nuclear Safety Culture is a transversal discipline, and a strategic driver for all nuclear organizations, so the design of a MOOC divided in four independent NOOCs will allow the flexible participation, interaction and learning experience of professionals from the nuclear sector, from other industries, master students, and young talented students and professionals. The use of Learning Analytics and other studies based on the hypotheses made during the design phase of the course will give us valuable results on the MOOC impact.},

As a solution for improving the quality of medical education, an emerging form of eLearning, namely, Massive Open Online Courseware (MOOC) could be used as a potential tool. With its varied advantages, MOOCs have a wide acceptance amongst the global community. MOOC replaces the traditional brick and mortar classrooms by providing an open online knowledge repository and enables a collaborative learning environment. However, for MOOCs to be accepted as a medium for imparting medical education in India, it is necessary that MOOCs is recognised by all the medical colleges and institutions. MOOCs would not only improve the quality of medical education but also, as a spin off, would result in the improvement of healthcare service delivery, thereby benefitting each and every citizen of India.},

Scalability is required when the number of learners and the number of learning resources increase. This work targets dialogue-based systems used for Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platforms to reduce human resources for answering technical support requests. The dialogue-based system must be available 24/7 and response immediately mainly to platform- specific frequently asked questions which were identified by an analysis of needs on existing support requests. Based on this comprehensive concepts, prototypes were implemented to prove the feasibility and explore the possibilities. The achievements of the deployment of a dialogue-based system for a MOOC platform were evaluated with well-defined metrics. These metrics showed, that even when deploying the most basic version of a dialogue-based system, the number of support requests created is reduced and thus the costly manual effort.},

abstract={MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) are definitely one of the best approach to support the international agenda about inclusive and equitable education and lifelong learning opportunities for all (SDG4) [1]. A great deal universities and institutions offer valuable free courses to their numerous students and to people around the word through MOOC platforms. However, because of huge number of learners and data generated, learner’s behaviour in those platforms remain a kind of black box for learners themselves and for courses instructors who are supposed to tutor or monitor learners in the learning process. Therefore, learner do not receive sufficient support from instructors and from their peers, during the learning process [2]. This is one the main reasons that lead to high dropout, low completion and success rate observed in the MOOCs. Many research work have suggested descriptive, predictive and prescriptive models to address this issue, but most of these models focus on predicting dropout, completion and/or success, and do not generally pay enough attention to one of the key step (learner behaviour), that comes before, and can explain dropping out and failure. Our research aims to develop a deep learning model to predict learner behaviour (learner interactions) in the learning process, in order to equip learners and course instructors with insight understanding of the learner behaviour in the learning process. This specific paper will focus on analysing relevant algorithms to develop such model. For this analysis, we used data from UNESCO-IICBA (International Institute for Capacity Building in Africa) MOOC platform, designed for teacher training in Africa, and then we examine many types of features: geographical, social behavioural and learning behavioural features. Learner’s behaviour being a time series Big data, we built the predictive model using Deep Learning algorithms for better performance and accuracy (Thanks to the power of deep learning) compared to baseline Machine learning algorithms. Time series data is best handled by recurrent neural networks (RNN) [3], so, we choose RNN and implemented/tested the three main architectures of RNN: Simple RNNs, GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) RNNs and LSTM (Long short-term memory) RNNs. The models were trained using L2 Regularization, based on the predictions results, we unexpectedly found model with simple RNNs produced the best performance and accuracy on the dataset used than the other RNN architectures. We had couple of observations, example: we saw a correlation between video viewing and quiz behaviour and the participation of the learner to the learning process. This observation could allow teachers to provide meaningful support and guidance to at risk or less active students. We also observed that, the shorter the video or the quiz, the more the viewer. We conclude that we could use learner video or quiz viewing behaviour to predict his behaviour concerning other MOOC contents. These results suggest the need of deeper research on educational video and educational quiz designing for MOOCs.},

The focus of this work is to present possible methods of introducing `self-study', in the engineering education so that it eventually leads to `life-long-learning'. The suggested methods can be included in any course and when successfully implemented in most courses, leads to the graduating engineer understanding the need for `life-long learning', and it is expected that the engineer shall engage in independent study through-out his professional career. The work also discusses the role of the faculty in developing the `self-study' component in a course.

Some students are selecting their courses without knowing their inner ability. In this paper, how the student should select the different courses based on their learning styles in different levels is derived. This is achieved by eliminating the outliers in collected data from students. Since the data collected from students based on their learning styles is categorical, outlier detection analysis for categorical data is used to eliminate outliers from this data. These outliers are occurred while collecting data from students. Because some students are very peculiar, some students are not interested to reveal their data, some students may give wrong answers for any questionnaire by bias and some students may give incomplete data due to lack of time. The data is collected from B.Tech students from different colleges for experiments. After eliminating outliers from this data by proposed outliers' techniques, different classifiers are applied to frame set of rules to select suitable courses based on their learning styles. The results are better when proposed method is applied.},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to explore the determinants of learner satisfaction in blended learning environment by examining learner readiness variables. This research examined the relationship between learner readiness and learner satisfaction and identified the predictors of learner satisfaction. The participants were 325 undergraduate students who took a blended-format courses in one of the private universities in Malaysia. Data was collected using an online survey. The analysis of the quantitative data indicated that learner satisfaction has statistically positive relationship with learner readiness. This means that students who perceived high level of readiness to learn in blended courses tended to be more satisfied with their courses than those who perceived low levels of readiness. Additionally, the outcomes from the multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that there are five critical factors of learner satisfaction namely performance expectation, self-directed learning, online communication self-efficacy, motivation for learning and learner control The findings strongly indicated the importance of learner readiness in predicting and understanding learner satisfaction in blended learning environment. The implications and limitations were also discussed in this paper. This study highlights the importance for institutions and instructors to cater for learner satisfaction in implementing blended learning to optimize students' experiences so that learning outcomes and satisfaction could be enriched.},

abstract={With the emergence of a knowledge driven economy, these are times of brisk business for institutions providing training to professionals. The flipside of this is that there is an ever increasing demand on them to create a growing number of new courses, and serve an ever increasing flow of customers ata faster and faster pace. In its various flavours, this problem is faced by MOOC/online course providers, training departments of large organisations, and modern universities which offer short term courses for corporate audience as well. Hence, there is a need to optimally utilise all available resources: time of trainer/trainee/organisation, infrastructure etc. while designing and conducting training courses. Current practice is to do this manually. In this paper, we build a case for automation of this process. We present mathematical models for 3 problems in this space. Once a mathematical model of a problem is developed, it becomes possible to carry out several analyses on these problems, design automated solutions. As is revealed from the mathematical models, the problem of training curriculum design has already grown beyond the complexity that a human expert can handle efficiently. With every passing day, the gap will only increase. Our simulations establish the efficiency and effectiveness of the solutions we provide.},

abstract={Many of the demands of scale appear at odds with quality, such as in the case of online MOOC degree programs. This paper presents research that focuses on reducing this dichotomy. Examination essays are important learning tools in for-credit courses. Psychology studies show they drive deeper learning strategies and invoke higher levels of cognitive processing in students. High-quality feedback is another critical aspect of students' learning in advanced education. Key components of high-quality feedback are how expeditiously feedback is presented and how unambiguous it is. Examination essays are time-consuming for educators to grade, and at scale this may create an incentive for superficial feedback that may also reach students in a less than ideal turnaround time. This imposes clear scalability constraints and a potential decrease in course quality in online for-credit MOOC programs. We propose an annotation-free artificial intelligence-based approach for the automatic generation of examination essay rubrics and its subsequent utilization as part of high-quality feedback to students. It utilizes a combination of the natural language processing techniques TextRank and semantic similarity for automatic rubric generation and concept map creation for feedback presentation. The feedback is immediately available upon essay submission and offers the student a conceptual analysis of the submitted essay against the assignment's learning objectives.},

abstract={Software test effort estimation has always been a challenge for the software practitioners, because it consumes approximately half of the overall development costs of any software project. In order to provide effective software maintenance it is necessary to carry out the regression testing of the software. Hence, this research work aims to propose a measure for the estimation of the software test effort in regression testing. Since, the effort required developing or test software shall depend on various major contributing factors like, therefore, the proposed measure first estimates the change type of any software, make test cases for any software, then calculate execution complexity of any software and tester rank. In general, the regression testing takes more time and cost to perform it. Therefore, the effort estimation in regression testing is utmost required in order to compute man-hour for any software. In order to analyze the validity of the proposed test effort estimation measure, the measure is compared for various ranges of problem from small, mid and large size program to real life software projects. The result obtained shows that, the proposed test measure is a comprehensive one and compares well with other prevalent measures proposed in the past.},

abstract={This paper is a survey of the availability of open data sets generated from Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs). This log data allows researchers to analyze and predict student performance. Often, the goal of the analysis is to focus on at-risk students who are not likely to finish a course. There is a growing gap between the average researcher (who does not have access to proprietary data) and the ready availability of data sets for analysis. Most research papers studying and predicting student performance in MOOCs are done on proprietary data sets that are not anonymized (de-identified) or released for general study. There are no standardized tools that provide a gateway to access usable data sets; instead, the researcher must navigate a maze of sites with different data structures and varying data access policies. To our knowledge, no open data sets are being produced, and have not been since 2016. The authors survey the history of MOOC data sharing, identify the few available open data sets, and discuss a path forward to increase the reproducibility of MOOC research.},

With more time and different motivations, people increased the enrollment to MOOC courses in more than 10 times than usual. There was a re-discovery of webinars to share valuable information and the authors explored on the effectiveness of their use to expose the content of MOOCs as a pre view for potential learners. Webinars are increasingly used in education to present information and teach skills with wide dissemination and high impact. This work explores on how a successful webinar is defined in many different ways. The important thing to remember is to use key metrics to be informed and then improve the online event strategy. The manuscript presents the experience of a series of webinars and constructs on previous success cases and best practices while organizing webinars.

abstract={The real classroom conditions are very challenging for the teachers and administrators because of having the diversified students with and without special needs in an inclusive classroom. It seems like the different colours of flowers in a single flask. To tackle the individual differences and to maximize the educational achievement of the every student it becomes necessary to upgrade the educational programs and course content in accordance with the diversified classroom situations. Diversified courseware technology honours the individual difference and satisfied the specific educational need of each student. Diversified Courseware technology enhances self-learning to students, teachers and trainers with the help of diagrams, animation, assessment tools, teaching notes and exercises. It has been observed that the usage of computer learning and courseware technology in education system has increased dramatically since its inception. The time and place is no more big issue in communication because of internet. However, more work is required to be done in the area of graphics to improve Diversified courseware technology to enhance the Educational Achievement of Students with and without Special Needs in the Inclusive Classroom. Through this paper we try to focus on the requirements and the challenges in the field of Diversified Courseware technology to enhance the Educational Achievement of Students with and without Special Needs in the Inclusive Classroom. We also emphasized on reading skill, application of computer in distance/regular mode, rural/tribal education and courseware technology for classroom aids, assessment software, reference software and various technology used in computer learning.},

abstract={Teaching and learning is an important process in any educational system to evaluate the performance of both students and the entire system. To meet the great demands for educators and to fill the gap between teaching-learning process and learning outcomes, a great shift is required in an assessment system. Assessment being an important performance measure, it should give an opportunity to students to explore their thinking skills. The present study focuses on analyzing the thinking skills present in an assessment using revised Blooms Taxonomy standards. Three different categories of courses have been considered for the present analysis to study the different thinking skills that are present in an assessment paper. It also analyzes the complexity level present in an assessment and to know the quality of the system. Present study uses a weight-based data mining approach to classify the Blooms categories and the thinking levels associated with that. This study also reveals that the identifying the thinking levels is not same for all kinds of course types.},

pages={200-205},
abstract={After being used to a procedural style of programming, programming in an object-oriented style seems to be difficult. The problem analysis skill is also important where it leads to designing solution for complex problems. In the process of problem analysis, it is big challenge for the students to identify classes, attributes, methods and association between the classes from a given problem statement/Scenario and then mapping to program code. The problem analysis is part of design thinking, where it consists of five phases Empathy (Emphasize), Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test. In this course we implemented a modified standard "Design Thinking Framework" through structured enquiry assessment, in our framework few phases are overlapping and it is defined using following phases-1. Define, 2. Ideate & Prototype, 3. Test. This framework is add-on to our previous practice where a comprehensive tutorial for "Object Oriented Thinking" is conducted first to minimize students difficulties. Also it includes "laboratory experiment categorization" to help students in improving problem analysis and design skills. By using the above said approaches, it is observed that the students are able to use object oriented concepts efficiently to solve problems, design solutions and performed better in semester end examination.},

abstract={As the educational organizations worldwide are moving towards bringing education experience on Internet, via Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on Massive Open Online Education Platforms (MOOEPs), the retention of the enrolled students throughout the course is still a huge challenge. Although the online education has an immensely noble aim, i.e., to provide free\less expensive quality education to everyone, but if the existing MOOCs are upgraded to more captivating environment for users, a drastic increase in the user engagement in the course can be achieved, and hence MOOCs' providers can reach their ultimate goal in a more ubiquitous manner. In this paper it is suggested that this divide between a MOOC and user's engagement can be bridged with Gamification. Gamification is the use of game design elements in non-game contexts. Here an experimental environment was setup to compare the results of a small vocabulary course distributed among 100 candidates, and a comparative analysis between the gamified learning method and conventional learning method has been done. After the completion of the course a small survey was also taken from the candidates who had gamified tool. The results show that if the learning platform is gamified, it does not only drastically increase the user enrolment but also increase user engagement throughout the course. Gamification also makes learning, a unique and amusing experience.},

Furthermore, it provides high level system architecture to highlight key aspects of the technology infrastructure and the functionality of the software system. The rationale of the approach follows the tenets of several converging theoretical perspectives emphasizing the value of learners' dialogue and constructive argumentation as knowledge building processes during collaborative activities. The MOOC teacher (domain expert) is expected to play a key role by entering in the system conceptual links that guide the agent to make relevant questioning interventions. Thus, the agent tool is mediating group-teacher interactions in a MOOC environment aiming to increase the transactive quality of peer dialogue. The paper discusses also the `Academically Productive Talk' model that provides the basis for the agent interventions and the major software components of the system, including the colMOOC Editor and the colMOOC Player.},

abstract={e-Learning is the use of information and communication technology to enable people to learn anytime and anywhere. E-learning is a support tool for educators as well as a medium of delivery of any-time, any-where delivery of content to a dispersed learner community. Emotions are also important in teaching and learning and often find expression in particular ways, such as interactions with others and motivation in learning. Although both emotions and interest can increase learners' likelihood to engage in traditional learning, little is known about the influence of emotions and interest in learning activities in a digital environment. The aim of the research is to develop a computational model for recognizing learner emotions in online learning. Therefore, the study has developed Online Achievement Emotion Questionnaire (AEQ) tool which is suited for the online learning environment. Also the study has identified six parameters which represent the learner's level of learning during the learning experience. Finally the study has analysed and evaluated the correlation between the learner emotions and the observed behaviour. This research study therefore developed a novel model of affective online learning which can be use as a tool to recognise online learner's emotions with regard to the performance in learning.},

abstract={Cloud based systems are more popular in today's world but fault tolerance in cloud is a gigantic challenge, as it affects the reliability and availability for the end users. A number of tools have been deployed to minimize the impact of faults. A fault tolerable system ensures to perform continuous operation and produce correct results even after the failure of components up to some extent. More over huge amount of data in the cloud cannot monitor manually by the administrator. Automated tools, dynamic deploying of more servers are the basic requirements of the todays cloud system in order to handle unexpected traffic spikes in the network. This proposed work introduces an autonomic prospective on managing the fault tolerance which ensure scalability, reliability and availability. HAProxy has been used to provide scaling to the web servers for load balancing in proactive manner. It also monitors the web servers for fault prevention at the user level. Our framework works with autonomic mirroring and load balancing of data in database servers using MySQL master- master replication and Nginx respectively. Administrator keeps an eye on working of servers through Nagios tool 24×7 monitoring can't be done manually by the service provider. The proposed work has been implemented in the cloud virtualization environment. Experimental results show that our framework can deal with fault tolerance very effectively.},

pages={138-144},
abstract={In Finland and globally, many university teachers are teaching without pedagogical training. Employee training courses on pedagogy are offered via contact teaching, thus excluding potential students who are too busy to attend sessions at a specific time and place. In addition, majority of teaching is in Finnish, even though, for example, in the University of Turku, 10% of all employees are international. Due to limited teaching resources, university pedagogical studies used to be only available for university staff members who have teaching duties, excluding the majority of doctoral students from the courses. The UNIPS learning platform, developed by eight Finnish universities, was created to solve these problems. The current study investigates the impact UNIPS solution has on the above mentioned issues by looking quantitatively (N=590) at (1) which departments participants come from? (2) Are participants' doctoral students or university employees and (3) what are the age and gender distributions of participants? In addition, participants' perceptions of UNIPS studies are analyzed qualitatively. Based on the findings, UNIPS courses and similar MOOCs seem a promising way to support teachers' pedagogical training. They can not only increase the diversity of offered studies, but also help create a more inclusive environment at universities.},

abstract={With the aggressive progress of technology and the need to cater the high-end training in offline and online mode in order to generate the industry readiness engendered the need of having an platform for online content delivery, which turned into a trend of digitization of contents and evolved the Massive Online Open Courses. With the evaluation of multiple online content delivery platform and methodologies, the blemishes of MooC are also getting noticed. This paper addresses the problem of focused content generation and classifications of open contents into methodological order and social media based collaboration. This research paper also demonstrates the algorithm for collecting open contents relevant to a specific course. Finally this research results into a working prototype of a new type of MooC called vMooC or Vishnu Massive Online Open Course.},

abstract={There are a large number of foreign language learners in China. Lots of research has been done on how to improve foreign language learning efficiency, but in reviewing the foreign language learning researches, it can be easily seen that the cultural effects on foreign language learning have not been given its due attention. Much of the research has been done within the scope of particular theories. This thesis attempts to explore the science of foreign language learning from the perspective of cultural effects on language learners, especially the effects of culture on foreign language learning beliefs. The efficiency of foreign language learning can be improved by improving learning strategies, which in turn are determined by language learning beliefs. The language learning beliefs are adversely affected by such cultural factors in Chinese culture as patterns of social hierarchy, face, collectivism and past oriented time concept. These cultural patterns help explain the existing language learning beliefs in China. Understanding the effects of these cultural patterns on foreign language learning beliefs, foreign language teachers can better understand students' learning beliefs and help students in turn with the evaluation of their learning beliefs; students of foreign languages can develop their own independent understanding of the foreign language, avoiding some false language learning beliefs.},

abstract={With the explosive growth in the World Wide Web over the past few decades, a predominant part of the pedagogical arena is making a transition from stereotype textbook learning to massive open online learning. Efforts are being made to develop and foster crowd sourced massive open repositories of learning objects, which can be tapped to author courses for diverse learners with varied backgrounds dynamically. Developing systems to author and deliver such courses has been of rising importance to contemporary researchers and this paper proposes an efficient context-aware open e-learning environment to do the same. The learning objects having high aptness to the particular course and high content-based predicted rating pertaining to the particular learner's preferences are picked from the open repository and the course structure is modeled using communicating dynamic Petri nets. Ratings and feedback from the user are obtained during presentation, based on which the course delivery is made adaptive. Rating prediction through Collaborative filtering is used for this purpose. The ratings are also used to implicitly learn the learner's preferences and to establish an aptness score for each learning object.},

abstract={The society that we are interested in living today breathes and, more and more, is in conformity with a globalization that is too often likely to resemble an awkward attempt at value and cultural uniformity, for an apparent inclusion.If on the one hand the technologies are there for a daily globalization, as if easy knowledge were implicitly included, on the other hand precisely this possibility of spreading knowledge within a process of reflection on the dimension of inclusion that brings with it.The reflection that you want to ask comes from the extensive experience in the field of MOOC and their progressive use. A commitment not only in the field of training but also, and increasingly, for the diffusion of knowledge.The dissemination of knowledge, which can be used with the MOOC, is aimed at promoting the direct use, enhancement and use of knowledge for the social, cultural and economic development of society; this now stated is what for the Italian University is the "third mission" after the fundamental objectives of teaching and research.We therefore want to highlight how the MOOC and the OPEN approach have what in economics is called ROI (Return Of Investment) in terms of inclusion and digital citizenship, to also lead to an intercultural dimension.A perspective that does not lead to defining paths of uniformity but paths of inclusion represented by discovering interconnections even before common points.The spirit that permeates this work can be summarized in a thought by the French biologist Jean Rostand "All human diversity is the product of the almost infinite variety of gene exchanges. We are all made up of the same chromosomal powder; none of us has a single grain that can claim as his. It is our whole that belongs to us and makes us ours: we are an original mosaic of banal elements" [1].},

The interest of learners waned over a period of time. The major problems faced included: lack of pre-survey, inclusion of too many elements in MOOC, heavy workload per week, lack of pre announcement of dates for assignments, lack of immediate feedback on posttests, minimal interaction among learners, inaccessibility of platform on mobile phones and technical failures. The course should have been offered as self-paced course, inclusion of hands-on experience, less workload per week, computer graded assignments providing immediate feedback and more interaction among learners.},

A case study of how, MOOC on 'User Experience (UX) provided by Udacity for mobile app' was utilized to enhance the quality of student projects, is presented in this paper. Most of the time, MOOCs are provided by the global experts who teach the course in a best possible way. Also, MOOC directly helps in attaining lifelong learning skills. MOOC can be used in many ways to deliver a curriculum. This paper focuses on, how the learning's and activities specified by MOOC on UX is included as part of student project course, its assessment, evaluation and results. The student projects are mobile apps specified by a company, which emphasized much on UX, the latest industry need. Therefore students were instructed to register for the MOOC on UX and learn on their own. Each student teams had to do UX design as specified in MOOC and same UX design activities were included as a part of project course assessment and evaluated. As a result, students were able to discover additional requirements addressing mobile UX and perform UX based design and construct according to it. These activities helped to attain ABET criteria 'i' with attainment 7.82 on scale of 10.},

abstract={According to an air quality monitoring survey done by Greenpeace, India has PM2.5 levels, which is arguably higher than safety limits. It is essential to impart environmental education to denizens of India. Previous solutions include usage of Mobile Apps to aid in sharing Air Quality Index as a part of EGovernance initiatives. To aid Government in boosting the efficacy of E-Governance service for pollution control and provide environmental education, we intend to design an intelligent framework that utilizes social networks. In this paper, we have proposed an automated framework for pollution control E-Governance service which takes the user profiles on social networks and data collected from Internet of Things (IoT) based air pollution sensors as input. The prototype utilizes Machine learning algorithm to avoid human intervention and social networks as a platform to aid in outreaching environmental education to large masses of people.},

abstract={Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is a network comprises of mobile nodes connected without any centralized administration. Each node in the network has the ability to share a large number of objects with other nodes. The nodes are connected with other nodes to forward a message to other nodes until the search for node that desire meets. This paper represents a new replication method to recover the performance in distributed system. Objects are replicated on different nodes in the network to minimize the search for an object. It is observed that mobility of nodes predicted using SOM (Self Organizing Maps) technique provides less accuracy. This paper represents an algorithm that uses the network parameters as input condition to replicate objects into the nodes. The decision for each node will be taken by gathering the input conditions and feed to the Hopfield Neural Network. It is view that it will provide more accuracy and improve the performance.},

abstract={The aim of this work is to present an innovative framework to enhanced learner engagement and motivation on massive open online learning environments. The paper explores on the impact of applying Educational Data Mining in combination with Learning Analytics techniques, through a framework called Digital Learning Ecosystem (DLE) to provide students a complete and different learning experience along the course. This work presents in detail the design and applying of a DLE with different strategies to help students overcome the learning process difficulties that arise in a massive, open, and online course. The proposed framework is based on the importance of creating engaging experiences before, during and after a course completion to increase learners' participation and reduce dropout rates. This study analyzed data obtained from edX course “Java Fundamentals for Android Development” developed by a group of Professors of the Faculty of Computer Engineering, and the Department of Research and Development (GES) of Galileo University. The data set consisted of a post-course survey, participants demographic, solution activities submission, and final grades. The results obtained are analyzed in terms of student perceived usefulness, motivation, student's usage of tools and students' attitude towards DLE, degree of satisfaction, and engagement.},

Some students learn through lectures, some by doing themselves and seeing others doing. Undergraduate learns more when the teacher or the subject convinces them mentally. The evaluation component which provides an opportunity of their active participation motivates to them learn the concepts and ensure the consistency in learning over the semester. Project Based Learning (PBL) is a one of the technique of students' assessment to enhance the learning/understanding of the subject which involves the enrolled students mentally as well as physically and creates a sense of fair competition along with improving their communication skills. The PBL techniques actuates peer learning, develops a sense of curiosity about the concept and their application in day to day life. Effective teaching contributes significantly in students learning and achievements, which requires systemic approach of course administrations including fair and transparent evaluation components.

Using a comparative framework, we map the expected outcomes of higher education against popular global MOOCs and the recently launched Indian version - SWAYAM to evolve the strengths and weaknesses inherent to both modes. Global MOOC platforms score highest on student centric parameters including learning design, opportunities for lifelong learning, better accessibility. The strength of SWAYAM lies in its qualitative evaluation systems as well as recognition of credits, equity of access and affordability. Traditional HEIs have a clear edge over global MOOCs and SWAYAM in terms of long term impact on citizen and society building and shaping individual opinions.},

abstract={Augmented Reality is one of the most fundamental enabling technologies of this era which modifies our perception to such an extent that we are able to see, hear and feel the ordinary everyday objects in a new and enriched way. This technology is an amalgamation of Real and Virtual Worlds which aims to enhance the physical information by exactly super-imposing the computer generated content on it. The technology can prove helpful to surgeons and doctors to visualize and train a surgery, can instruct a mechanic for repair of an unknown piece of equipment, can serve as a source of entertainment, can help soldiers for spotting enemy snipers, and can be used as an efficient teaching aid for education. A typical Augmented Reality (AR) system requires the integration of hardware and software with factors such as Tracking, Registration, Interaction and Display playing an important role in the system design. The focus of this paper is specifically towards surveying the available Tracking Techniques for various Augmented Reality applications.

abstract={Mobile applications for MOOC platforms often can download learning material — namely videos — for later usage without the need for an Internet connection. As learners want to perform such data-intensive tasks with a WiFi connection, manual planning is required. By automating the download management, learners can be supported by always having video material available independent of the current Internet connection. This work examines the current download behavior shown in three MOOC courses. Hereby, influencing factors like the dependence on time and date, as well as the network state were analyzed. The results show that learners are already aware of data-intensive learning activities. They mostly download videos when connected to a WiFi network and consume pre-downloaded video content when using a cellular connection. An estimate of the potential for automated downloads using a simplified approach revealed the possibility of making an additional 19% of the video consumption network independent. The download behavior in the three courses examined differed noticeably so that automated downloads should be seen as an additional feature that can be activated per course.},

abstract={Higher education in general and professional education in particular, graduates have to acquire required knowledge, specific skills and attitudes. Project work is one of the major components that aims at inculcating most of the required attributes in any undergraduate program. One of the most important activities of the practicing engineer is finding solutions to problems that arise by applying his knowledge and converting physical principles into useful devices/solutions. This involves creativity, imagination and reasonably strong analytical ability. These qualities can be nurtured in a systematic way. Realizing the importance of these aspects, project work plays a major role in achieving the above objective. The quality of the project work depends upon its selection process, size and complexity and support of the faculty-mentor. Some of the reputed institutes such as IITs follow the standard assessment mechanism to evaluate the quality of project work, but there is lot of scope for improvement. This paper discusses various aspects of improving assessment methods of project work and demonstrates an outcome based assessment method to evaluate the quality of project work in alignment with the recent guidelines introduced by National Board of Accreditation (NBA) for undergraduate programs.},

abstract={Mobile Learning (MoLearn) is a learning application created specifically to accommodate the learning needs of students with the goal of gaining more learning experiences with more effective mobile devices. Answering this challenge, MoLearn application that has been built previously with web-based and Android needs to be developed. In accordance with the lifestyle of its users, in this case high school students, the MoLearn application was developed using the concept of Gamification. In learning, gamification is an approach in the learning process that uses elements in the game with the aim to provide motivation, build comfort for learners, and interest in the learning process. By utilizing the concept of Gamification, a prototype of MoLearn application development was designed by giving attention to the three elements, i.e character, interactivity and feedback. The development of this application takes into account every student activity that focuses on goals, reward mechanisms, and progress tracking. Gamification, a key review of MoLearn's application development as a concept in the process of creating participative learning experiences and active learning.},

abstract={Students are generally forced by their parents to take different courses without knowing their inner ability and their interest. To choose suitable course it is necessary to assess their learning styles and inner ability. In this paper the learning styles of students have been assessed based on Felder and Silverman's “Index of Learning Styles questionnaire”. While collecting the data from students using ILS questionnaire, some inconsistent data may be generated due to many reasons. To build correct decision making system to select suitable courses it is needed to eliminate all such inconsistencies from the original data. The data collected from this questionnaire is a categorical data. Different outlier analysis techniques for categorical data have been used to eliminate outliers in this paper. Nearly five hundred records are collected from various engineering colleges from different branches of engineering. After eliminating the inconsistencies from data, different classification models have been built and their accuracies at different levels are compared.},

abstract={Globalization, Customization and Web 2.01 are having substantial effects in the Education sector. For this, the government of India has taken strong steps towards Collaborative E-Learning which yields significant social, educational, financial and research profits. The learning infrastructure has improved many folds providing easy access to innovative technologies. But, for its utmost utilization, there is need to identify the intended learners and their cognitive requirements to produce precise E-Content and Content Management Systems (CMS)2 to match the learner's needs, cognitive ability and learning attitude. Keeping this in view, the present study suggests a cognitive agent3 based expert system for collaborative E-Learning. The system drives on learner's cognitive ability. It simulates the human thought process during teaching-learning activity and collaborative learning; and thus, provides the relevant, unambiguous E-Content. The system can be used to obtain an insight to the learner's cognitive aspects and willingness to learn in social interactive environment. Based on the empirical data gathered, the system instructs the learner for self paced learning or social interactive learning. The system is referred as CAESMCE-Learning (Cognitive Agent based Expert System for Metacognitive and Collaborative E-Learning). The agent acts as a software artifact that exhibits intelligent behavior in a very complex domain like human learning where the system attempts to model the cognitive process associated with learning. The system is like an intelligent agent which is reactive, instructable, adaptive and cognitive. The property of instructability is important since by allowing the instructional designer to feed the agent with new knowledge during its execution, it helps to solve the knowledge acquisition problem. The system models human intelligence and human perspective of the world using BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) Model. In the context of this study, Metacognitive E-Learning is a computer-supported self paced collaborative learning approach which assists the learner to become more aware of the learning attitude and learning requirements and thus, make strategies for learning based on the experience. Metacognitive approach can help the learners to help themselves. This system can be used to determine the learning pattern and thought process of the learner during the learning activity. It can be used to study the impact of self paced and collaborative E-Learning on learner's cognitive capability. It is no longer confined to the delivery of instructional packets delivered to learners and then evaluated by the teacher. Now, the emphasis is on self paced social learning using social software such as blogs, wikis, podcasts. It works on the principle that the knowledge is socially constructed and learning takes place through conversations about content and grounded interaction about problems and actions. It is believed that one of the best ways to learn something is to teach it to others. Cognitive agents are best suited to solve such complicated problems in the domain that requires extensive human expertise and time. They simulate the human reasoning process with the help of knowledge base and inference engine. Education system would be revolutionized with the use of Cognitive agent based systems for learning, teaching and planning. Metacognition refers to the knowledge concerning one's own cognitive processes and products or anything related to them [5].},

abstract={Universities are pressed to update their educational processes in face of the changing students' needs, the companies and industries requirements and the surrounding society evolving context. Never has this challenge been so dramatic and so immediate as it is now, in this COVID-19 pandemic! Much of the burden to adapt the teaching processes and the learning methodologies has fallen onto teachers that were required to improve their pedagogical and technical competences to be able to handle the present societal needs. Teachers must now be able to blend online activities with face-to-face teaching and to reuse existing open contents into their teaching practices to adapt efficiently to this new reality. This paper analyses and discusses the needs of teachers in such contexts, namely when Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are blended with other forms of learning. This study was conceived and designed before the current pandemic but it has been rendered even more relevant by this situation.},

pages={54-59},
abstract={The major challenge of Team Based Learning (TBL) or Group learning is its Design and Implement that assess the student's knowledge and skills. The challenge also includes designing assessment to grade the students based on their contribution to the team performance. Teacher assessing the student's performance in team is a teacher biased process. Therefore Peer evaluation can be included as part of TBL assessment. Peer review is considered as transparent and efficient technique to assess individual in team. But it has also been criticized with respect to fairness. This paper proposes Trusted Relative Peer Review (TRPR) which reduces the disadvantages of peer review to greater extent. It includes two reviews i) Team's Guide review ii) Peer review. The trustworthiness of peer review is decided based correlation of Guides and Peer reviews, depending on which each student is rated relatively for 100 points. After comparisons of results, 65% student teams peer reviews were found to be not trustworthy, which are corrected through proposed TRPR. This review is accepted by 54-58% of students and trusted it. TRPR helped to measure "ability to function in a team" with attainment of 7.7 on the scale of 10. TRPR contributes to the success of TBL implementation in greater extent by overcoming the drawbacks of peer review. It influences individual student's marks based on their contributions. Therefore it ensures students contribute in group work resulting in students learning. Although TRPR is hectic, future work shall try to make it simple.},

abstract={With the enormous increase in Massive Open Online Courses across different platforms and domains, the course related information is being overloaded. It becomes a very tedious task for the learners to search for the required courses matching their individual goals, knowledge, and interest. MOOCs recommender system plays a vital role by easing this task and providing courses of interest within an efficient time frame. This paper proposes an effective MOOC recommender system with the help of various data mining techniques. It encashes upon the fact that the learners involved in the MOOCs can be easily divided into two categories of active and passive learners based upon their activity logs. It first channelizes the learners into these categories and then provides separate recommendations by applying different data mining approaches. Through this technique, an average accuracy of 92 percent was achieved in case of active learners for the course recommendations.},

abstract={During the last decades, our society is witnessing an authentic revolution that, in a dizzying manner has deeply influenced, modified, and transformed the way of life of human beings. This constant and unstoppable revolution is transmuting all areas of our life: social, cultural, personal, labor, economic, training, etc. This new society is characterized by a high generation of knowledge and the constant and fluid processing of information. In this macro-context, the MOOC phenomenon emerged. MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) courses are based on the principles of massive, free access to all materials and resources offered online. This new didactic path can be constituted in an innovative techno-social tendency, especially oriented in the panorama of Higher Education to stimulate university improvement, open opportunities at the same time for education and training or, simply, derive towards a new business model for the universities. In addition to being an entry point for the popularization of science and knowledge, the future possibilities are enormous and are being studied in all their various dimensions. Many initiatives as a result have been developed to implement this new form of education. MOOC Courses and the Future of Higher Education presents the latest research theories and current examples of MOOC courses practices in Higher Education. The chapters represent an extensive assortment of interpretations and practices examples of MOOC courses, across areas as varied as teaching methodologies, instructional innovations, educational technology, etc. This work is structured in three sections, the first one covers the university institution in the knowledge society, the second analyzes the MOOC training proposals, and the third discusses the future role of MOOCs.

We need to evaluate the accurate assessment of the performance of any institution. Currently the decision in ministry of higher education and scientific research is taken randomly, not based on logical analysis. Moreover, the education towards to universal, the ministry of higher education in Yemen has to activate the council of accreditation, and support it to start quickly and effectively. In this paper, we have used approach to assist the council for accreditation to start automation for accreditation operations and mechanisms, that's proposed by using machine learning techniques, also to help decision makers for taking accurate and swift decisions. Our study is used to classify institution that wants to take a license from council to three classes: grant license of accreditation, grand license provided to improvement has done, or not granting accreditation license. We have used the intelligent algorithms for calculate probability of grand accreditation license based on degree of council standards, which we used to predict through a model building to classification by using Naïve Bayes algorithm. The proposed method is typically for evaluation the new institution by depends on evaluation of existing institutions. We experiment the proposed framework by flexible parameters and attributes with private training dataset, that's carefully generated and tested using real life applications.

While the training requirements can be different with respect to the contexts of managing different disaster types there can be generic training requirements that should be incorporated into all types of disaster management training. Another key aspect of disaster management training is to associate new tools and technologies that facilitate disaster management and relief work. Wireless sensor based disaster management is an emerging research area that promotes technology incorporation into different levels of disaster management tasks. In this work we explore the training for disaster management activities with wireless sensor networks. As the training platform we use a novel, yet increasingly popular and learner engaging, immersive environment OpenSim. In an OpenSim installation, a specialised training environment was developed to simulate several disaster scenarios and required wireless sensors. A set of users have successfully used the training environment and provided feedback. The next phase of the research is planned to produce a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) to facilitate academics and students for disaster management training.},

abstract={Building refers to a structure with enclosing elements such as Roof, Wall and Floor that is used for certain purpose and function. The basic function of a building is to provide shelter to its user and promotes comfort. Building Services plays a vital role in building design as it provides a controlled environment to the occupants in the building. A building with proper integration of building services has a structural soundness and which is related to the productivity of the user. In engineering education and architecture education, the building services subjects related to plumbing, water supply and sanitation, electrical services, fire safety etc. are taught in a theoretical approach. The theoretical approach of the building services subject for one semester gives limited knowledge about the building services and its application in building design, which finally results in poor performance of the building. The integration of the building services are also a difficult task to achieve with the theoretical exposure. The basic concepts are taught to the students in a theoretical approach using conventional teaching methods with chalk boards for teaching the basics and detailing through graphical representations, sketches etc. Then the students are requested to do case studies related to integration of building services in the building through industrial visits for better understanding of the basic concepts and detailing. There are various teaching models such as Black Box Approach, Glass Box Approach and Participatory Approach available in education of building design. These approaches require certain tools to execute the knowledge acquired in building services into the building design process. A study has been conducted to develop an effective teaching method to teach building services which enhances the capability of the students in better design and detailing of the various building services. The paper aims to explain the application of the participatory tools such as Full Scale Simulation Modeling and User Behavior Modeling for teaching building services through the Toilet Design in engineering and architecture education. This teaching method with full scale simulation tool can be considered as the alternative teaching methodology for the professionals in academics to teach building services and make better understanding of the knowledge of building services in the students.},

The Massive Open Online Course is a response to the challenges faced by organizations in order to collect related information of several matters. Spoken-Tutorial is prepared from the term that “information is everywhere” as a social network, you are a clickware of this digital world. A world where internet is a medium to access mass information. So, MOOC is the one way of learning in this digital social network world. MOOC is a course-Open, Participatory, Distributed and Lifelong networked learning. It has facility of various courses, with start, end dates and participants. It's a way to connect and collaborate while developing digital skills an engage in a learning process. It is an EVENT around which people who care about a topic can gather and talk about it in a structured way. MOOC can promote the network learning for lifelong. People that have reputations for interesting skills and innovative thinking besides a topic, collaborate by opening an online course covering that topic. Anyone can join it. In a MOOC we can choose what we want to do, how we want to participate and we can decide if we have been successful, just like an existing atmosphere. Tutorials on almost all the Free open source are run by Spoken tutorials which is available on the internet and is provided by the team of spoken tutorial project.

abstract={Although the foundation for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) was laid down around 2008, it is in the recent years that there has been observed the stupendous rise of MOOCs. Currently there has been much debate regarding its pros and cons. While access to high speed internet connection, computer systems and possessing a decent knowledge of the language that the course is instructed in (usually English) may prove to be barriers in some countries, this digital education offering has undoubtedly provided a learning edge to students and others, who can overcome these hurdles, irrespective of their geographical location, financial condition and time constraints. The two MOOC providers: Coursera and edX, have emerged as the major MOOC services over the years due to their tie-ups with numerous prestigious universities, free courses, user-friendly interface, and strong business model. The learning is primarily through videos and the MOOCs learners spend significant time in viewing course videos. This paper is the first survey-based study of its kind, to the best of our knowledge, conducted to explore the learner's perspective on video-viewing features offered by these two MOOC providers The survey assesses video-viewing related features on Coursera and edX namely, subtitle captions/transcripts, in-video quizzes, video duration, quality and video speed varying feature as experienced by the student participants, who have participated in both edX-offered courses and Coursera-offered courses.},

abstract={Over the past decade, MOOCs have risen to prominence in part because most do not carry heavy requirements regarding accreditation, scope, and evaluation. While this has allowed MOOCs to proliferate, it has led to difficulty under-standing what completing a particular MOOC means. Individual MOOCs can vary tremendously in their quantity of content, their depth of assessment, and their mechanisms to ensure academic integrity. In order for MOOC credentials to have value in academia and the workplace, however, there must be some trust in what a particular credential means about the learner. In this work, we perform a study to understand the variety of MOOCs available, then pro¬pose a MOOC Content Matrix as a short, objective way to summarize what a particular MOOC entails and, in turn, what value its certificate gives.},

abstract={Online education has become the first choice for millions of Internet users around the world to get access to knowledge and skills. Many studies aim to implement performance prediction to mark learners with high risk of poor performance in the early stage of a course. Among these researches, the employment of features concerned with learning behaviors combined with machine learning techniques proves effective to achieve decent prediction results. However, the experiments of most existing researches are based on one or two courses, making people wonder whether there is a universally applicable prediction model for multiple courses. In this paper, we investigate performance of different prediction models with the perspective of big data. We collect the background data from 28 representative courses in different subjects on a popular MOOC platform in China, and evaluate the effectiveness of the existing predict models on them. The results show that 1) Within the scope of one course, it is wise to combine different activities data for prediction, and XGBoost is most effective prediction methods in most cases;2) There does not exist a generally feasible prediction model that works for all courses.},

pages={88-93},
abstract={In order to achieve excellence, it is important for the educational institutions to assess the outcomes of their graduate programmes. In general, the graduate programme outcomes are assessed through direct (examinations, projects, assignments etc) and indirect (co-curricular, extra-curricular, surveys etc) methods. The results through direct assessment are followed up with several actions such as remedial classes, tutorials etc. Accomplishments in Co-curricular, extra-curricular activities and Feedback surveys from the students, recruiters and alumni are considered for the indirect assessment of Programme outcomes. To improve these indirect assessment methods, some institutions are getting feedback for few activities manually. With the increasing use of ICT in education and mobile learning, we decided to launch a new mobile and web based indirect assessment tool (IAT) for assisting the programme assessment committee in our department. This tool automates the process of recording student's surveys, efficiently analyzes the feedback data from number of perspectives and produces ready-to-use reports which help other wings of the department such as Industry interaction, Research, Student's activities and Faculty development to decide future targets and follow-up actions. This tool contains well structured questionnaires for obtaining feedback of students on the course they learn during mid of a semester and end of a semester. The tool also collects feedback from graduates, alumni and employers to ensure an all-rounded assessment. The proposed Indirect Assessment Tool (IAT) has been implemented using web technologies such as HTML, PHP, JSON and JS. The tool has been tested successfully and is involved in indirect assessments of our degree programme since 2015.},

Female tribal populations are particularly disadvantaged for a variety of reasons including vulnerability to exploitation and abuse. This study investigates factors contributing to the high dropout rate and evaluates the success of a computer literacy intervention with tribal girls who had previously dropped out of the education system. A sample of 31 students in two centers was administered a survey to identify why the girls had dropped out of the school system. The analysis showed three clusters of learners. The students received computer literacy training after which they took an externally certified examination in basic Digital Literacy and computer concepts. Policy recommendations to decrease the dropout rate, ensure safety, and encourage further education for tribal girls are presented.},

abstract={An entrant to engineering has to undergo many fundamental courses in the first year of curriculum. Basic Electrical Engineering is one amongst these courses. The traditional way of teaching the course was teacher-centric and aid used for teaching was chalk and talk. Less emphasis was given for student interaction. Traditional style of teaching rarely gives students the opportunity to apply their newfound knowledge to actual situations, resulting in a serious time lag between students learning and applying new knowledge. As a result many students have trouble determining the relevance of what they are being taught, and thus lacking any obvious need to learn and fail to engage in the learning process. In teaching learning process, learning style of an individual is important to undergo different learning cycle. The three main types of learning styles are, auditory, visual, and tactile. With the help of a tool students learning style was identified through a set of questionnaires which helped to design an activity depending upon the learning styles of a student. From the survey it has been identified the majority of the class are visual learners which helped in designing an activity. The proposed model is applied to the course on Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering. Apart from the regular classroom teaching, principles of instruction was used to select, plan and develop an activity based on Industry visit to enhance students learning. To realize the impact of learning happened through the industry visit pertaining to topic on actuators the written examination was conducted and feedback at two intervals, before and after the industry visit was taken. Individual question wise inferential statistical analysis using paired t-test was performed and inferred that the activity improved the knowledge and exposure level of a student with different learning style. From the activity it is also inferred that though a small percentage of students are auditory learners, visual learning has helped the student to enhance the conceptual learning through visualization.},

abstract={Plagiarism refers to the stealing of intellectual property-ideas, words, thoughts, conclusions, without giving proper credit to the author Young students and novice researchers lack the skills to identify and avoid plagiarism and thus end up in committing it. Anything available through the digital world and Internet is considered to be free of any legal or intellectual property issues by some writers and researchers, thus leading to the immense growth of plagiarism. Though digitization has led to an increase in plagiarism of contents, it has also led to the development of plagiarism detection tools that are used to combat it. Plagiarism has been rising at steadfast rate due to a number of factors, the major ones being lack of awareness and fierce competition to excel. This paper highlights the various aspects of plagiarism and the various steps being taken by the Indian government to curb this menace. We have also discussed survey results and conclusions based on the seminars conducted to make students aware about plagiarism, its consequences (through the case studies) and the means to curb it. The paper also highlights the various challenges that we are currently facing in combating plagiarism and some potential areas that researchers can look forward to.},

abstract={Owing to the large number of students that academic institutions have to accommodate, automated evaluation of students' programs has received impetus in recent years; an automated evaluator not only ensures speedy evaluation but also consistency in distribution of marks. A construct that appears frequently in programs is the else-if block. The condition that appears in a subsequent else-if block should not be weaker (i.e., less general) than any of its preceding conditions, otherwise this block will never be executed (in other words, this block qualifies as dead code). Such wrong ordering of conditions in else-if blocks are often introduced by novice student programmers. It is to be noted that such violation of precedence of conditions in else-if constructs qualifies as logical error which is not detected by standard compilers, such as gcc. In this work, we tabulate different cases to identify the correct and the incorrect precedence of conditions in else-if constructs and thereby, automatically report such errors in students' programs and also provide feedback towards error correction.},

abstract={Today's world lays more emphasis on embedded product design which necessitates the inclusion of hardware courses like Digital Electronics, Computer Organization and Microcontrollers in the curriculum for undergraduate program in Computer Science. These pre-requisite courses introduced in the lower semesters pave the way for students to develop keen interest, skill and proficiency in the area of Embedded system design. But students of Computer Science generally lack interest in hardware related courses, a fact which has been observed time and again by teachers handling these courses. Therefore the challenges that lay before the course instructors was to make the students take interest in these courses and also to make them industry ready so as to compete with peers from other engineering branches in the domain of Embedded Systems. This paper discusses the experience of the authors in teaching the course on Digital Electronics laboratory. In order to handle the challenges mentioned above, after much debate and discussion, amongst all stake holders, it was decided to apply structured enquiry based learning strategy. Structured enquiry is a form of pedagogical practice that facilitates students' to build on previous learning and provide a strong foundation for further learning in relation to the objectives defined. This approach was also found to enhance the quality of teaching as a result of which students' ability to conduct investigations of technical issues consistent with their level of knowledge and understanding improved. Here we present a set of activities, their related outcome based assessment techniques and outcome based strategies applied to the laboratory course on Digital Electronics in Computer Engineering at the III Semester level. The course was designed to consist of initially, conducting simple exercises to provide hands on experience and use of appropriate modern engineering tools to simulate the designed circuit for the given problem statement after which it was prototyped. Along with the regular lab experiments, student' teams were made to work on course projects which required them to design and build projects. This promoted their self-learning, improved their knowledge of digital circuit design well beyond that directly taught in lectures, improved students' creative thinking, applied logic ability and practical thinking. This paper discusses the attempts made by the course teachers to achieve these goals. The first step was to set appropriate course outcomes (COs). The subsequent step was to align the COs to suitable Program Outcomes (POs) through relevant competencies (CAs) and performance indicators (PIs). Later rubrics were written to assess the attainment of each of the Program Outcomes. This activity resulted in enhanced motivational levels amongst students, increased their involvement in the team and improved their knowledge due to self learning.},

abstract={During the last decades, our society is witnessing an authentic revolution that, in a dizzying manner has deeply influenced, modified, and transformed the way of life of human beings. This constant and unstoppable revolution is transmuting all areas of our life: social, cultural, personal, labor, economic, training, etc. This new society is characterized by a high generation of knowledge and the constant and fluid processing of information. In this macro-context, the MOOC phenomenon emerged. MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) courses are based on the principles of massive, free access to all materials and resources offered online. This new didactic path can be constituted in an innovative techno-social tendency, especially oriented in the panorama of Higher Education to stimulate university improvement, open opportunities at the same time for education and training or, simply, derive towards a new business model for the universities. In addition to being an entry point for the popularization of science and knowledge, the future possibilities are enormous and are being studied in all their various dimensions. Many initiatives as a result have been developed to implement this new form of education. MOOC Courses and the Future of Higher Education presents the latest research theories and current examples of MOOC courses practices in Higher Education. The chapters represent an extensive assortment of interpretations and practices examples of MOOC courses, across areas as varied as teaching methodologies, instructional innovations, educational technology, etc. This work is structured in three sections, the first one covers the university institution in the knowledge society, the second analyzes the MOOC training proposals, and the third discusses the future role of MOOCs.

In this study the researchers sought to solve an observed problem of high failure rates in technical modules in the department of Information Technology by investigating the feasibility of using VLC as a teaching and learning tool in a rural university in South Africa. The researchers investigated the perceived attitude of students towards VLC by implementing VLC in an experiment set-up and allowing students to reflect on their usage experience. The results indicated that the VLC can be a useful teaching and learning tool for student performance improvement though they may be hampered by the unavailability of resources and poor IT infrastructure which could drive down adoption of VLC and by extension affect the pioneering of other e-learning technologies. The researchers propose a substantial investment be made in VLC systems in order for the students to enjoy the envisaged benefit of their usage.},

abstract={Analog Electronic Circuits (AEC) is a foundation course of many research fields in Electrical as well as Electronics Engineering stream. This is a necessary and an essential course for various analytical studies in Electrical Science curriculum. The course content emphasis on working of various analog devices and circuits, and their applications. Conventional Chalk-Talk method of teaching make students highly reliant on course instructor. Hence course was dealt with an objective of making students self dependent in the analysis of basic AEC. An attempt was made by the authors to introduce computer simulation in classroom teaching and laboratory for II year Under Graduate (UG) students. A survey was made to select an appropriate computer simulation tool which can aid students to use it even beyond college hours. Among different available tools, PSpice Schematics Evaluation Version 9.1 was opted. PSpice is an industry standard tool and is widely used for analog and mixed signal circuit analysis. Simulation was made a part of assignment, Self Study (SS) component and laboratory. The work presented in this paper discuss various types of analysis like transient, DC sweep, AC sweep, parametric, Bias point, and temperature analysis performed on typical analog electronic circuits. Authors also discuss about the difference in attainment comparing pedagogy method with conventional one.},

abstract={This paper addresses the different aspects about IIT Bombay's Spoken Tutorials initiative to transform Indian education and its resounding success in training students in different aspects, such as programming languages, simulation and circuit design platforms and office productive tools, using free open source softwares (FOSS). The Spoken Tutorial project aims to provide IT training through audio-video tutorials. In this paper, we discuss its methodology, objectives, features and its potential advantages. We also present some suggestions to enhance the functionality and effectiveness of Spoken Tutorials. There seems great potential in Spoken Tutorials project to act as a game changer in any student's career, and this can be better unearthed provided due care is taken in awarding Spoken Tutorial certificates during the well appreciated process of educating masses in IT skills. In order to better understand the impact of this project on students, we conducted a survey of around 150 students, who had participated in Spoken Tutorial courses. The findings of the survey are also presented in this paper. Most of the students well appreciated this and they also felt motivated to do more FOSS courses of Spoken Tutorials.},

abstract={Some of the major challenges of teaching programming course as an elective are spending more time on syntax coverage, lack of hands on session or practical sessions and less number of credits allotted for the course. It is extremely hard for any programming elective subject to attain the course outcomes because of huge variation in the students background, constraints of allotting less number of credits and traditional classroom teaching. The solution to this dilemma is provided by hands on session tutorials that transforms and enhances traditional classroom teaching. We proposed, refined the curriculum, and tested for teaching first elective course in programming languages. In this paper we present the effectiveness of teaching programming elective subject by introducing ”Hands on Sessions” and redesigning our curriculum to meet stakeholders requirements. Our results presented in this paper indicate that incorporating ”Hands on Sessions” in teaching programming elective subject is an effective tool to attain the learning outcomes of the course. In addition, new teaching methodology enhances the students problem solving skills and improves self learning ability.},

abstract={Undergraduate (UG) Research is the first step in a students' life to taste the experience of a research work. It is also a unique experience for the teachers to guide the students in research work during their UG study. In this paper we want to share our research experience through the project that involves the building of a Robotic arm which mimics the motion of the human arm of the user at Humanitarian Technology (HuT) Labs of Amrita. The system monitors the motion of the user's arm using a Kinect. The skeletal image of the arm obtained using the “Kinect Skeletal Image” project of Kinect SDK, consists of 3 joints and links connecting them. Coordinate Geometry is used to calculate the angles between the links connecting the joints. This gives us the angles for a 3D representation of the human arm. The angles thus obtained are sent using a serial communication port to the Arduino microcontroller, which in turn generates signals which are sent to the servo motors. The servo motors rotate according the angles given as input. The combined motion of the servos results in a complete Robotic arm movement which is a mimic of the human arm movement.},

abstract={The role of ABET accreditation system is quite significant in providing guidance towards program and course design. The program outcomes encompassing through knowledge, skill and attitude play an important role towards competency development of the students. To improve the employability quotient of these fresh graduates, the alignment of respective outcomes along with the base lined expectations of IT industry is needed. In this context Software Engineering (SE) plays an important role in the transformation journey of the graduates to become entry level developers. It also helps to bridge the gap between academia and IT industry so that these new hires are productive as soon as possible. In this paper, the expectations of an IT industry from the new hires is described in conjunction with ABET educational outcomes highlighting pedagogical aspects that enable students develop these abilities. SE course is used as vehicle and an approach is presented integrating software code of ethics (recommended by ACM - IEEE), SE principles, pedagogical aspects and assessment instruments. Subsequently experiences from our corporate learning environment are highlighted.},

abstract={This paper addresses p-processes single processor scheduling problem with a common deadline, to minimize the total execution time and reduce the penalty costs. Process scheduling is one of the most essential factor on which the efficiency and the performance of the work done by the CPU depends. Earliness and tardiness of the processes degrades the efficiency of the processor as they carry penalty costs with them. Thus, the scheduling problem of minimizing the total sum of earliness and tardiness with a common deadline on a single processor is important and competitive. Scheduling is particularly one of the subset of combinatorial optimization problems, which are in fact NP-Hard problems. This problem can be solved using heuristic and meta-heuristic approach such as genetic algorithm for optimal results. In the experiment performed, the Genetic Algorithm outperforms the results in comparison with a simple heuristic method.},

abstract={In today's era, graduates need to acquire the competent skill sets to get a good job. The traditional education model suffers from the limitations of assessing these skills. Outcome Based Education (OBE) model plays an important role in this context by overcoming the above-specified issue. OBE empirically measures the student performance and helps to demonstrate the skills that are clearly articulated to them at the start of the program. Accrediting bodies are focusing more on the assessment of student learning outcomes. Every year huge datasets of assessment data are accumulated using OBE model. If analyzed properly, this data can be used to predict student competencies. Manual record keeping and attainment calculation make it a challenging task to extract meaningful information from this ever-growing data repository. The proposed work implicates the construction of a framework to automate the attainment process using the assessment and mapping data of Program Outcomes and Course Outcomes retrieved from an indirect assessment tool. The attainment data so obtained is used to predict attainment of various programs and courses using the classification techniques. The work done helps the instructors to find meaningful information from assessment data and helps them to take proactive decisions to improve the attainment of low-performing courses. Moreover, with automation of attainment calculation, manual work for the faculty is reduced, resulting in time-saving and better focusing on attainment improvement and various other scholarly activities.},

abstract={This paper analyzes the implications of gender when evaluating team assignments in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). It contributes to the line of research focusing on group work in MOOCs from a gender perspective when peer grading is carried out. In turn, it informs MOOC design. The results are based on a study of 6,000+ participants of a set of IT, business, and Design Thinking MOOCs to determine success in gender homogenous and heterogeneous virtual team tasks. The study uses observational data to track individual performance, based on gender, in online courses. Even though men were over represented, individual female performance in team assignments is shown to be significantly better than male performance. The results speak for successful teamwork in online courses on the one hand and open up further opportunities for good performance of women in STEM disciplines on the other hand.},
