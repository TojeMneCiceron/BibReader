abstract={There has been a dramatic expansion in both the amount of available large-scale educational databases and educational mining techniques. Educational data mining has been a fertile subject of research in recent times; further, the use of educational data mining has become popular among both researchers and practitioners. Log files generated by computer-based learning environments like Intelligent Tutoring Systems contain a wealth of information about learner behaviors that characterize academic success. There is growing interest in mining these data sources for knowledge-based discovery to reveal relevant, meaningful, and useful educational information to illuminate our understanding of learners' behaviors and outcomes. All too often however, extracting the pertinent information from the data to leverage the data mining techniques can be a major roadblock; for example, the asynchronous nature of the data logged in computer-based learning environments and data mining tools pose several challenges for mining data. We sought to mitigate this by developing a parser for the BioWorld System. In this paper, we explore the viability of a hand-coded parser by presenting BioWorldParser (a suite of scripts), which was developed to parse and retrieve data from raw log files generated by the BioWorld system, to help leverage educational data mining techniques in the context of an Intelligent Tutoring System for the medical domain.},

abstract={Self-directed learning is a potential methodology recommended in medical education to promote life-long learning. To promote self-directed learning skills and to make students life-long learners, self-directed learning sessions were conducted at Melaka Manipal Medical College (Manipal Campus), Manipal University, India. Students' knowledge in the topics was assessed in three formative assessments conducted during the course. This study was conducted to explore whether there is any change in students' readiness for self-directed learning as they experience the curriculum, and also to find out whether the change is reflected in students' academic performance in topics learnt through self-directed learning. To assess the change in self-directed learning readiness, self-directed learning readiness scale was administered to the students at the commencement and at the end of first year of the MBBS course. Students' scores in all three formative assessments were also collected. There was a statistically significant increase in self-directed learning readiness of students at the end of year compared to the commencement. Students' scores significantly increased in second and third when compared to first formative assessment. A weak positive correlation between the assessment scores was observed. The study demonstrated that students' readiness for self-directed learning was increased as they experienced the curriculum which was reflected in their academic performance.},

abstract={To teach and demonstrate the Power System Stability aspects to the undergraduate students, a laboratory model has been developed. Computer based simulation software's are used to teach different aspects of power system by most of the Institutions. These simulation studies often do not demonstrate the physical sense of power system behavior to students. Moreover, making the students to visualize the effect of instability is a very big challenge faced by the teaching community. This paper describes the experimental set up built in the Electrical Engineering Department of Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore, consisting of an alternator connected to infinite bus through parallel transmission lines. In this experimental setup, the generator is brought to instability by changing the operating conditions. Further, the oscillation is controlled and brought back to stability by controlling the excitation and line reactance. This gives the clear idea about stability and its enhancement to the students.},

abstract={Comprehensive curriculum is essential for overalldevelopment of professionals. Like other countries, in Indiatoo the engineering educators have a task of insistingattainment of graduate attributes to suit the global needs. Teaching engineering courses help us to attain the programoutcomes [1]. However, real challenge lies in efficientattainment of ethical principles and effective functioning ofprofessionals as a member in diverse team by effectivecommunication. Thus proper guiding and assessing practical engineering skills is the need of the hour. We focus on educative growth of ethical and communicative skills attained in the present study wherecapstone project is taken as an example. The project issubdivided into two level first the pre-project and the finalproject. Capstone project is an amalgamation of all the basiclearning and the application component of the curriculum. In order to evaluate the attainment of ethical skill andcommunicative skill, the assessment rubrics need to bedesigned well. This work discusses the manner which canmeasure the attribute attainment quite precisely. After acquiring fundamental knowledge on engineering subjects, the students are made to work on acapstone project. Attainment of the program outcome (PO)is quantified with a class with seventy students. The finalyear under-graduate students are divided into group of fourto the maximum. A topic and a faculty adviser ofcorresponding specialization is assigned to each of thegroups. Rubrics of formative assessment are attentivelychosen to incorporate the attributes of ethics and soft skills. Bimonthly evaluations were graded by the guide anddepartmental faculty other than the guide. The summativeassessment is done along with an external examiner from the neighboring institution. Mode of attainment of courseoutcome (CO) to PO has been discussed in the full paperalong with the state diagram of the evaluation process. Asthe students go ahead with execution of the project throughregular meetings with guide, the communication is assessedby rubrics which emphasize the report writing skilldevelopment. The written communication skill is thensubsequently corroborated by oral presentation. Thepresentation is evaluated again to judge the oralcommunication skill as a part of a team of maximum fourmembers with varied aptitudes. Another important point isin the rubrics we have introduced plagiarism check to ensure the ethical attribute of the graduate. By keeping a threshold value for acceptance limit of plagiarism one can evaluate the skill of written communication and originality of thoughts. The attainment of CO to PO is graded from theformative assessment score in pre-project work and finalproject work. In order to take in-depth evaluation, we havetaken 75% of the total marks as the criteria for assessing aparticular skill of a student. Capstone project is consideredas culmination of all the teaching-learning in the curriculumfor the discipline. After framing the rubics and mapping ofthe particular Course Outcome to Program Outcome, logichas been exercised selectively to map with either strong ormoderate attainment of the latter. The process and it's prosand cons will be discussed in detials in full paper.},

abstract={In India, a large percentage of graduating engineers are not industry ready. The primary reason is that the colleges have outdated syllabi leading to a wide gap between the curriculum and the requirements of industry. Students who take up internships are very few among Tier-2 and Tier-3 colleges. All these problems result in graduates who are unemployable without training in basic skills by the industry. An internship could help the students in overcoming many of these shortcomings as they learn about corporate industries and receive basic training. This paper presents a novel initiative towards this end by the IEEE Student Branch, College of Engineering, Chengannur. It aims at spreading awareness about the advantages of taking up internship opportunities, providing the basic training and helping students get internships. The program was a huge success and helped a large number of students in securing internship offers. This model, if replicated in other colleges could significantly improve the employability of students and help them improve their academic performance and engineering skill sets.},

abstract={Higher education or lack of higher education effects many socioeconomic characteristics such as employment, income and social mobility. Increasing access and removing barriers to higher education is a key factor in allowing people from different socioeconomic backgrounds, to make significant change in their own lives.The psychometric test - the screening and entry test used by higher education institute in Israel (the equivalent of the US SATs) is one of the barriers standing between young people in Israel and higher education.Many factors contribute to the ability of an individual to pass this test, some of have nothing to do with ability or motivation. Factors regarding an individual's socioeconomic background affect the outcome of the test, and therefore the access to higher education.While 72% of all individuals how finished high school, belonging to the highest socioeconomic group in Israel, take the test, only 21% of the lowest socioeconomic group do so. The average gap between individuals from the highest and the lowest socioeconomic background is an unimaginable gap of 200 points (out of a possible score of 800 points). This figure means the difference between higher education and no higher education, and everything that stems from it.An industry of about 80,000,000$ (more than 250,000,000 ILS) a year has grown over the years, around preparation courses for the test, with an average coast of 2,500$ (8,000 ILS) per course, giving an unfair advantage to whomever can afford it - the already privileged groups of society.The Ministry of Social Equality in Israel has launched a free massive open online course designed to help university applicants prepare for the psychometric test. With a foreseen Return on Investment of over 605,000,000 ILS in the next 15 years, the course is designed to remove or at least lower one of the barriers to higher education, and promote equal opportunity.This article will elaborate on the reasons behind the decision to create a free open digital course by the government, designed to help learners prepare for the psychometric test. It will touch on the outcomes of the first course runs, and the ways in which the Ministry of Social Equality plans to reach relevant publics and mitigate the course to those publics with little to no experience with digital learning, language barriers, low digital literacy, and low self-efficacy.},

abstract={With the development of latest technologies and their usage become wide spread in all areas of the world. Moreover, using large amounts of data and also their applications are sophisticated and thus the technologies lead to consume huge amounts of energy, latency, bandwidth and also throughput. In the case of client server communication, the client is completely depending on their server at computation logic; meanwhile, the application logic is only performed at the client. When the age of thin clients becomes popular in developing countries with the profits of security, reliability, less vulnerability, maintainability and sustainability have been moved to the usefulness of their inevitable good behaviors. Interactive applications can be caused some bottlenecks of performance delay over thin client server network. The safest technique to access the smooth performance is the explanation and reintroduction of overclocking method which can be used efficiently for the system under some special considerations which was not warranted by manufacturer's rating. As overclocking is not a new method, many researchers have been used it in a variety of application fields and mixed with other resource demand machine learning methods. This paper figures out that thin clients are used with Remote Desktop Protocols connection and the rendering of interactive applications (only used Benchmark apps) on them successfully accomplished by overclocking method.},

abstract={Various learning models have been proposed till date. Many dimensions have been included in different learning models proposed by different researchers. This paper summarizes a number of dimensions important for consideration in learning models. An improved multistage learning model has been proposed which include a large number of factors proved successful earlier. Factors for successful learning have been included from cognitive science perspectives also. Use of this learning model is surely going to prove better for overall success in the learning process.},

abstract={Scripting language employ high-level constructs to interpret and execute one command at a time. In general scripting languages are easier to learn and faster to code than structured and compiled languages such as C and C++. Scripting languages have many important advantages over traditional programming languages. In future the usage of these languages is likely to increase. In this paper we discuss and report our experience in teaching scripting languages lab at the undergraduate level, 4th semester. Scripting language is an umbrella term used for languages like unix shell, TCL, perl, java, python and LISP. Out of these, we have chosen UNIX shell programming and python for our curriculum. The authors report various pedagogical activities like multiple assignments, peer assessment within a group, self learning through e-resources and course project that were employed during the course. The course projects were specially designed so as to make students explore the vast number of python packages. The authors found that these activities definitely enhance the learning experience and there was a remarkable change in the learning level of the students as compared to previous years as evident in the grades obtained by the students.},

Teaching such subjects in a meaningful way is always a challenging task as the students feel that writing code in assembly and Embedded C is difficult. The programmable controllers and processors are taught to Electrical cluster students which usually include Electronics and Communication Engineering, Telecommunication Engineering, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering and Electrical and Electronics Engineering. The traditional method of teaching these subjects was faculty centric where the teacher teaches the theoretical concepts using blackboard or power point presentation. To enable the students to learn the practical applications, there is a need for a new approach of teaching the subject where in the student's performance is evaluated based on various factors such as communication skills, analytical skills, professional ethics etc. In this direction, the paper focuses on the methods based on Outcome Based Education (OBE), adopted by the author to make the students understand the subject better.},

In this paper, we explore all facets of SWAYAM, from its inception to its day-to-day functioning to how the platform is meeting its goal of increasing access to quality education across India. We linger on SWAYAM's most distinctive feature: its credit system, that allows higher education institutions to integrate MOOCs into their offering. We also present some of the early achievements of the platform: In December 2018, the first SWAYAM examination was conducted, with about 16% of India's public higher education institutions allowing their students to earn academic credit through MOOCs taken on SWAYAM [2, 3]. In the second SWAYAM examination, conducted in May 2019, that number grew to 21% [2, 4].},

The translator in a translation not only constructs sense at the stimulus of the source text, but also makes meaning for the readers in the target language, using the target text as a stimulus. Thus the process of translation is divided into two steps: the construct of sense and the make of meaning.},

abstract={In these days of intuitive and intelligent software systems the audience is not going to put any effort into using the product, application or operating system – they'll expect it to be obvious. The perception of any software is driven entirely by its User Interface (UI). Usable software sells better and unusable software is abandoned. Designing usable UIs is challenging and instilling such designing skills in students is even more challenging. This paper investigates Experiential Learning methodology used to imbibe UI Designing Skills in students through the course "Principles of User Interface Design". The primary objective was to attain Graduate Attributes/Program Outcomes (POs) 1, 2 and 3 as defined in the Outcome Based Education (OBE). The approach comprised of two main activities – Identifying Good UIs and Bad UIs and Designing UI Prototypes. A rubric based assessment was used to test the concepts' realization among students. This novel approach did not claim to have given students deeper knowledge in UI designing. Nevertheless, it did aim for a useful foundation. The approach can be adopted in designing good UIs in mini projects and capstone projects.},

The results obtained for the first study indicates that there exists moderately strong relationship. The second study shows that correlation coefficients of related courses are better while that of some unrelated courses have moderate value. This means that in case of related courses the skills acquired in a prerequisite course can help them to do better in the current course. This exploratory analysis when properly interpreted can help plan and retrospect and re-adjust the mode of assessment or course delivery to enhance student learning.},

abstract={Dedicated servers are deployed by companies to meet the ever growing computing demand. More storage and more security are sought after by companies. The inefficient scaling of hardware, higher deployment time, installation of old operating systems on new hardware are just some of the areas where dedicated servers suffer. Cloud severs can be used in lieu of dedicated servers. This will not only decrease the overall IT budget of companies but will be more flexible. This paper is a survey done on three start-up companies to inquire about the dedicated servers. Amazon Web Services have been used to rent a cloud server which hosts a website. Comparisons are done graphically and some observations drawn by the companies' executives about cloud and dedicated servers are mentioned in the latter stage of the paper.},

abstract={One of the original purposes of MOOCs is to democratize education worldwide in order to advance towards a fairer society and universal human development. However, initial findings suggest that there are a number of challenges that MOOCs face to achieve their maximum potential in developing countries and regions with complex issues of access to high quality education. The majority of research studies on MOOCs focus on one or a small number of courses, or an overview of an entire platform or system, such as edX or FutureLearn. However, these kinds of investigations can mask important regional variation in different parts of the world. In this study we conduct a longitudinal analysis using data from six years of courses from MITx and HarvardX, focusing on the particular Arab world sub-population, and comparing to the rest of the world and also on their human development index. A close investigation of this subpopulation will help us better understand what kinds of course registration and course-taking patterns are influenced by regional cultural factors, and what dimensions of MOOC learning are more universal. In this work we present initial results after conducting exploratory analysis on 452 MOOCs (~4.5M unique learners) from MITx and HarvardX, which show that despite the important cultural and geographical contrasts, the general trends are quite similar. Still, we observe some significant differences, such as lower completion metrics for Arabic countries when performing this comparison within each human development category and also some differences in percentage of enrolments per course category.},

The challenge for us as course facilitator is to utilize the existing potential that information technology offers to prepare our students for this information revolution. In this regard, we have proposed an integrated learning framework by considering two courses, web technologies laboratory (WT) and advance database management systems (ADBMS) of sixth semester in information science department at undergraduate level to make students apply knowledge effectively in building real time applications. The key focus of integrated learning was attainment of focused outcomes b, c, g and k (ABET criteria).We are elated that we attained outcome i as a bonus, although it was not focused. In this paper, we show that integrated learning framework led to attainment of focused outcomes, improved skills in students such as presentation skills, teamwork skills, and problem solving skills. This also led to performance improvement in examination and increased student's confidence level. This makes students to stand out in crowd and acquire an edge in competition.},

abstract={Outcome-Based Education (OBE) is a student-centered learning method that focuses on empirically measuring student performance. OBE has become the standard of practice in the engineering education programme. The measurement of student performance is done using both direct and indirect assessment tools. The value obtained out of these tools are then transformed to a score and checked whether they meet the required attainment level of Course Outcome set for a particular Course. The scores of all the Course Outcomes collectively contribute towards the attainment of Programme Outcome. This process is recursively applied for four years until the student completes the Programme. This paper presents a direct assessment method used in measuring the Programme Outcomes (POs) via appropriate direct assessment tools. A sample assessment presented in this paper shows a process of attainment of graduate attributes stated by NBA which are in line with the Programme Outcomes of Washington Accord.},

Anecdotal observations on individual student trajectories reveal distinct behaviors which may correlate with prior experience level. We build models to correlate these trajectories with student characteristics and behaviors of interest, specifically prior experience level and video engagement.

The science of psychology can answer all these questions. But surprisingly, we are never taught psychology as a mandatory science. The World Health Organization has defined health as "a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity". Today's curriculum gives more stress on physical well-being and, contrastingly, very less stress on mental well-being. The question arises “should psychology not be taught in elementary school curriculum?” Of course it should be!},

Introducing a programming language to students with no background is often felt to be challenging in terms of syntax and control flow of a language. The paper discusses an open source graphical programming tool built on Minibloq platform that allows students to focus more on creative part of programming. The paper proposes a graphical approach to programming where a student need not remember any constructs of a programming language, but relies on the approach to solve a problem. The programming utility is developed for an open source Arduino platform. Currently the tool is developed to control a real robot built around Arduino platform. Thus a platform to learn fundamentals of programming as well as robotics is made available to students. The graphical programming tool with the robotic hardware was found to be easy to learn by high school students during an outreach program conducted by the authors. The framework is also extendable beyond programming and can be further developed to understand robotics.},

abstract={Computer systems play an integral role in all facets of the engineering profession. Systems users are always in need of faster, more powerful, yet cheaper computer systems. This calls for an understanding of the processor-level components of computer systems, their design and operation, and their impact on the overall performance of the systems. To fulfill this requirement the course on Computer System Design and Architecture has been introduced in the 3rd semester. Earlier, there were two courses offered with titles “Computer Organization” in Semester 3 and “Advanced Computer Architecture” in Semester 8. These two courses were not related and there existed a gap of 4 semesters in learning of these two courses. Students were unable to appreciate the architecture related concepts in other courses of lower semesters. As mentioned in IEEE SWEEBOK curriculum recommendations, a wide semantic gap exists between the computer's intended behavior and the workings of the underlying electronic devices that actually do the work within the computer. This gap is bridged through Computer Organization. On the other hand Computer Architecture is the course that specifies the relations and parts of a computer system and it deals with mainly three elements viz. Instruction Set Architecture, Computer Organization and Hardware. Accordingly, a course on Computer System Design and Architecture which combines the study of Computer Organization and Computer Architecture is designed to be offered at semester 3. The next challenge came in the form of delivery of the course. Since a detailed conceptual understanding of computer organization and architecture is required, which was not possible only with classroom delivery, self study activity was introduced which provided ability to the students to compare various processor architectures, their functionality and visibility to information processing. This continuous process helped them acquire knowledge, values, skills and understanding that they will require throughout their lifetime.},

One of the biggest limitations/ challenges in MOOC today is conducting effective assessments in a large-scale environment. The quality of large-scale assessment is under threat from multiple sources including assessment instrument specific and measurement errors. Assessment instrument specific errors are related to the extent to which assessments meet its objectives while measurement errors are incurred during the process of evaluation. A survey of sample of existing assessment instruments used for large scale assessments is conducted to identify assessment instrument specific errors. In this paper, we have proposed the usage of technology to build electronic item banks for avoiding assessment instrument specific and measurement errors, thereby improving the quality of assessments. We have proposed 12 unique item types which are amenable for automatic evaluation. The process of evaluating students response automatically is discussed in detail for each item type. These automated item types provides cost effective ways for achieving validity and reliability for large scale assessments.},

This descriptive paper maps the microcredentials that currently exist, using data gathered from the MOOC platforms (e.g. Coursera, edX, Udacity, FutureLearn, and others). Data include price, length of program, availability of academic credit, and level of effort per week on over 450 unique microcredentials. This paper uses a two-step cluster analysis to group miocrocredentials across type, using factors including price, duration, and weekly effort. Grouping microcredentials across MOOC platforms is a first step to understanding what place these credentials might occupy in the overall landscape of higher education.},

abstract={The Indian higher education system in the post-independent times continued the colonial practice and so got isolated itself in the world higher education ranking system and not having indigenous ranking system meant we are practically working in the closed compartments. Except for a few research and management institutions, by and large the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) did not appear in the global rankings, this non- appearance is a reflection of a policy neglect on higher education system in the country, leading to only a few institutions finding their places in the world rankings conducted by different bodies. The policy response to address this problem was that India having National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) to rank HEIs. The two year old NIRF has to be made robust enough for it to become relevance in improving the quality of education system. To this end research paper systematically engages in content and discourse analysis of NIRFs methodology, to identify its gaps and make a policy recommendation for developing it into a robust framework.},

abstract={Outcome based education (OBE) has been adapted in major education institutions particularly in engineering education. This has been used extensively since the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) has made it mandatory for program accreditation. The OBE focusses on outcomes of the program rather than curriculum framed for the courses. Outcomes may refer to the knowledge or Skill gained, competency and employability of the graduates of the program. In order to achieve this outcome, the syllabus has to be carefully and meticulously planned with scope for continuous improvement. In the Department of Electronics and Communication, BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore, We have adopted the OBE system. This paper aims to provide the evaluation process in our department to measure the outcomes. For each course, the course outcomes (COs) are methodically articulated keeping the focus on Program outcomes (POs) that are defined by the NBA.},

abstract={It is well established that learners have different learning preferences. There are multiple ways of characterising learners based on their learning preferences available in the literature. Even though there are efforts to design pedagogic practices considering the learning preferences of learners, it still demands further investigation. Further, what factors influence learning preferences of learners is also an interesting dimension of research. This paper discusses about our observations over changing learning preferences of learners over a period of time and investigating the influence of factors like gender, urban / rural divide and medium of instruction on learning style preferences of learners. This study is desirable as it will help design content as well pedagogy respecting the learning preferences. Learning style preferences of students of undergraduate engineering degree programs are used for the purpose of this study. Though there are different learning style assessment methods / tools available in the literature, because of availability of software tool and the familiarity of authors with the tool, Questionnaire from Index of Learning styles (ILS) by Richard M. Felder and Silverman is used in the study. It is evident from the results that learners' preferences are changing from verbal to visual, reflective to active, sequential to global and sensory to intitutive. The results of the study are presented in the paper and discussed.},

The focus of the work is to suggest a method, where in, the student shall apply the tool to understand concepts of few courses of the on-going semester, or courses of previous semesters. This is achieved through an initial attempt to understand the usage of the tool, apply it to comprehend concepts in suitable courses, and finally use the tool to apply, formulate, design, implement and demonstrate a self-designed task, also known as the ‘Open-ended’ experiment. The proposed method of introducing the modern tool can be included in any semester, and when implemented in most semesters, leads to an overall development of the graduate with necessary attributes, as the proposed method includes an attempt to relate various courses in the program. The work concludes with details of results presented in the III semester.},

abstract={Graph theory has been demonstrated by many researchers to be useful during the conceptual phase of mechanism design. In this regard it has been put to use by many works for systematically synthesizing varieties of epicyclic gear trains (EGTs) of one degree of freedom. This paper makes use of the solutions derived using graph theory and introduces a procedure for identifying the constituent links corresponding to the chosen EGT graph concept so that it can be realized into a 3-D CAD model. It is seen that certain EGT graphs do not lead to meaningful 3-D representation. Conditions for a graph to result in a meaningful EGT structure are also derived in the process.},

abstract={Emerging load demand cannot be fulfilled by the output of one generator. Therefore two or more generators should be synchronized in order to share the load. The synchronizing variables of voltage magnitudes, frequency of the voltages, phase angle difference between the voltages and the phase sequence of the voltages should be considered. Synchronizers are widely employed in the industry. University students learn the theories of synchronization. Most of the laboratories in universities do not have practical modules or laboratory equipment to demonstrate the synchronization process. Traditional synchronization systems are not suitable for the visualization of generator synchronization. “A Practical Module for Generator Synchronization System” is designed to overcome the problem of understanding synchronization process. This system is useful for the students in understanding the synchronization process along with the real time simulation of the synchronization. The system will demonstrate the synchronization process of two generator outputs either manually or automatically. It will also synchronize two generators. The system consists of voltmeters to give the voltage of generator output, frequency meters to give the frequencies of voltages, bulb system to indicate phase sequence, a synchroscope and a phase meter to indicate the pulse width variation of two voltage outputs. The system is prepared for the laboratory equipment and tested under the laboratory conditions. This paper presents how the separate sections of A Practical Module for Generator Synchronization System were developed and its results.},

However, there is a strong feeling in the industry circles that students graduating from engineering colleges are not industry ready and many of them are not employable. Academia has also felt a strong need in terms of producing the necessary quality talent. It has been quite some time since industry and academia started working together to enhance the employability of engineering graduates and make them industry ready. Various models have been initiated by big industry captains to make this collaboration workable. But the big question is how effective these models are in terms of their applicability and usefulness to all the stakeholders in industry and academia. Through this paper, we discuss some of the offerings under the industry academia collaboration model. An analysis of various challenges being encountered during the evaluation of effectiveness of such models is also discussed. A few potential cost effective ways to address the underlying challenges are put forth towards the end of the paper.},

In order to attain the program outcome the curriculum for the program is designed in a manner that the students get trained in all the 12 Program outcomes. The courses are taught to the students by various teaching methodologies like class room teaching, laboratory experiments, seminar and projects. Each course is designed with specific CO's and each CO is mapped to the PO. The attainment of CO's is quantified by assessing students. Their performance is tabulated and analysed using MS Excel software. The quantification methodology involves detailed question paper articulation wherein each question is mapped to a CO and its corresponding PO. Thus considering continuous internal evaluation data one can measure the attainment of CO and the PO for a batch of students. The level of attainment also can be easily varied based on the level of the course and efficiency of the student.},

abstract={The technological rebellion has made current generations to depend more on the digital world in their day to day life. The effectiveness of the digital world has changed the learner's perceptive towards the education system. The impulsivegrowth of technology has increased the popularity of Information and Communication Technology which has created a research scope in Computer network domain thus Computer network course in the curriculum of Computer Science and Engineering plays an important role. It is always a challenge to teach Computer Networks course to students as the course requires a practical exposure more than the chalk and talk. It is very hard for students to envision the concepts of computer networks, protocols formats and understanding packets flow during teaching in classroom. To overcome above said challenge, pedagogical practice such as active learning through simulation tool is identified in delivery of the course. This paper discusses the effective use of a Packet Tracer (PT) simulation tool in the teaching of computer network concepts. A structured learning approach is introduced by using packet tracer tool in teaching network concepts and series of exercises are designed and developed to give the visualization of each layer functionality. These practical exercises helped in active learning to use the packet tracer to simulate campus network. This pedagogy practice encouraged the students' to build the clarity on the physical devices like router, access points, switch and their configurations. The troubleshooting skills were practiced by introducing the errors deliberately and how to resolve is learnt through the tool. Computer network simulation activity include the concepts of NAT, Subnetting, V-LAN setting, services of TCP/UDP, packet format details, application layer protocol like DNS, DHCP, E-Mail, FTP and HTTP. Activity is evaluated through demos, presentation and quizzes. Rubrics based assessment is followed to ensure uniformity and transparencyin the evaluation. The average marks obtained in quiz by students before using PT tool is 65% and after using tool is 85%, it shows significant improvement of 20% in learning the fundamental concepts of computer network course.},

These learning aids involve industry field visits to identify the process parameters of interest for monitoring and control in different application domains, formulate measurement techniques, identify primary sensors, transducers and their deployment, there by facilitating an opportunity for the students to not only connect the theoretical concepts to the real world application but also to develop an exploratory learning attitude, need analysis, communication skills thus helping them to evolve as a pro-active engineering professional. The details of the said approach are carried out at fourth semester level as an experimental basis; the metrics used for assessing the learning outcomes are presented.},

abstract={Recent technologies provide wide opportunities for learning at remote places and enables people collaboration anywhere. In this paper, we present the future advancement in the teaching learning process in India. As mobile phones and tablets are getting more keenly intellective and more widely used than in the precedent decades, they have become a familiar tool in our present environment. Utilizing them as a cognition tool calls for accommodations that are compatible with the concept of communication tools. Various studies suggest that ‘Digital education’ is comparatively more effective than traditional learning. The proposed system uses an inter network for teacher — student interaction and sharing of resources and messages. It allows knowledge-building and learning process to be run in collaborative learning environment. In this system, a student can create, collect and share inculcate data immediately anywhere, anytime. This enables them to play active role in knowledge building process. Hence, we have proposed a combination of m-learning and e-learning based application along with the concept of BYOD (bring your own device) which is advantageous to both the faculties and students of educational institutions for smart learning.},

abstract={In this study, we introduce a model that captures and visualizes the dynamical process of individual intention forming and the translation of this intention into actual behavior when learning in MOOCs. To validate the model and further our understanding of learning in MOOCs, we constructed a short survey based on this theoretically grounded intention-behavior dynamics model. This survey was sent to MOOC learners who at the time of their respective MOOCs indicated that we could contact them for further research purposes. The combination of open and closed questions referred to the most recent MOOC they took and was answered by 84 learners. The results revealed that most learners start a MOOC with a specific intention in mind, but that nearly one third of these learners reformulates this initial intention, once or more often, at some point due to barriers they encounter which hinder or prevent them from reaching their individual intentions. These barriers are mainly non-MOOC related, which may be valuable input for future research as well as guide the development of interventions for supporting learners to reach their personal learning intentions.},

pages={205-209},
abstract={Information systems are growing in both size and complexity. Object orientation has emerged as a dominant paradigm in designing and constructing such large and complex information systems, which is being taught to undergraduate students of Computer Science and Engineering. The use of java technology to develop applications is found preferred one [1]. There exists a knowledge gap between industry expectations and students knowledge. Hence deep learning of java programming is essential attribute to reduce the gap [1]. This paper presents classification of lab assignments as demonstration, Exercises, structured Enquiry type and open ended types with an approach of using conceptual model as intermediate step before writing java code for a given problem statement. This classification of assignments/problem statements move the responsibility from a professor to student where the latter involvement is observed high in achieving the objectives set for each type in classification of assignments, hence helps to meet industry expectations. The conceptual model, drawing a class diagram using standard notations (diagrammatic representations) improves the students understanding of object oriented concepts [7], for a given lab assignment which in-turn eases the student effort in translating the class diagram into program code by following the syntax. The students will be graded during assessment as Grade-S, Grade-A, Grade-B, Grade-C, Grade-D, Grade-E, Grade-F and where Grade-S is highest and Grade-F is lowest. The results of assessment are analyzed for year 2013 and 2014 batches and it is observed that, there is increase in grade A in year 2014 compared to year 2013. The observed change is due to the above said approach. The result analysis of year 2013 and 2012 shows that, the grade F is increased little in results of year 2013, it is due to the current approach where the lab assignments are classified and students are expected to apply the concepts studied effectively and few students unable to follow the approach.},

abstract={Every organization whether it be an enterprise or academic institute, should maintain a proper documentation of attendance of staff or students for effective functioning of their organization. Generally there are two methods of taking attendance in a classroom- calling out students name one by one or taking students signature on paper. However each of those strategies are time consuming, inefficient and moreover proxy can be easily given by students if strength of class is large since it is not possible to verify each student in person. A good amount of the time is wasted in taking attendance and even then many times attendance don't seem to be marked properly. Proxy of students in classroom is a perpetual problem that has to be addressed. Therefore an attendance management system is required which not only authenticates the student but also detect proxies. In this paper we combine privacy preservation and collusion resistance to propose an attendance system which uses an android application to mark student's attendance in the classroom and detect proxies given by students. It exploits the Bluetooth technology to ensure student is present in class itself rather than in the canteen or in the library. Based on the attendance given by students, a trust factor is assigned to each student to determine how trustworthy a student is.},

abstract={Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) offer web-based learning to a global audience. While we have so many institutions offering online courses, not many of them focus on laboratory courseware that would inculcate hands-on learning. Engineering is all about hands-on learning of concepts and needs an effective online laboratory courseware to complement the theoretical courses offered by MOOC. Unlike many Test and Measurement solution providers, who focus mostly on experiments based on their instruments and unidirectional flow of lab courseware, Tektronix launched an online community of lab courseware for basic teaching labs in electronics engineering. Educators across the globe can contribute to the content data base, and access the lab courseware created by other fellow educators. Template and sample lab courseware ensure that follow-on submission of courseware are rich in pedagogic elements and convers a wider spectrum of courses in electronics engineering. This paper is an attempt to present a case study of how this open-source platform is leveraged by educators to share lab courseware and enable fellow educators / students hone hands-on skills in electronics engineering.},

pages={31-33},
abstract={Since 2013, we have used all of the content from our Introduction to Biology Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) with students taking an equivalent on-campus, for-credit course in a mostly ungraded, blended manner. It appeared early on that students on campus watched the videos in high numbers, and more students answered practice problems from within video sequences than the (ungraded) problem sets or practice exams. As a follow-up, we asked, if the position of an ungraded problem impacts students' behavior to try practice problems. We hypothesized that placement of the ungraded problems in the course structure has a significant effect on the likelihood of a student attempting the problems. We predicted that ungraded problems placed immediately after a video segment within a sequence of videos would have a higher number of unique submissions compared to the same problem placed outside of the video sequence. To test our hypothesis, we performed A/B tests on the course content position of ungraded problems during both the fall 2015 and fall 2016 semesters. We positioned the ungraded problems in an appropriate video sequence or under the relevant problem set or exam available for practice in the course website. We found that more students attempted problems when the problems appeared in-between video segments for 34 out of 38 cases. Both sets of experiments (20 problems for 2015 and 18 problems for 2016) support our hypothesis that more students submitted answers to ungraded problems in the video sequence versus when we positioned the same problem in the course structure outside of the video sequence. These results indicate that the online course structure alone can influence student study behavior, a result potentially applicable to the design of blended learning experiences and MOOCs.},

abstract={Many students face cognitive overload and conceptual and navigational disorientation in massive open online courses. We used the learning logs of videos, the difficulty of exercises, the discrimination of exercises, and the student's ability, combined with deep learning, to determine the student's familiarity and mastery of video content. We then determined a knowledge node score, which we integrated with a knowledge map. The map could be personalized to recommend videos and exercises according to the knowledge nodes that had a low score. Therefore, students could learn where they needed to improve and adjust their learning accordingly. Moreover, teachers and teaching assistants could observe students' knowledge maps to understand their performance and help them accordingly.},

abstract={Pedagogy is the core of learning process. It goes without mentioning curriculum design and development play a significant role in creating a learning experience from the student entered fashion. Properly defined assessments with a well driven curriculum really throw a challenge to delivery methods. Thus, pedagogy is important in imparting the knowledge coupled with the requisite skill levels as specified by Dr. Benjamin Bloom. This paper is a case study of one such attempt to introduce new pedagogy by introducing the self-study component into the course delivery method. This has enabled the course instructor to create curiosity among the students in the class by way of challenging them through some minor projects and self-chosen activities to demonstrate their learning through application of the concepts learnt in the classroom and laboratory exercises. This unique change made students to think critically. The outcomes of the study are very much encouraging in two counts, one increase in the cognitive level (test marks improved) and the other is the improvement in skills through demonstrating the concepts by the students who were engaged and inquisitive.},

The popularity of the National Institutional Ranking Framework has led to the competition as more and more institutions are applying for India Rankings. The number of the institutions applying for India Rankings has increased from 1400 in India rankings 2016 to 3000 in India rankings 2017 and to 4000 in India Rankings 2018. We have carried out the study of India Rankings 2016, 2017 and 2018. The study has focused on the parameters, which are the Influencing Factors in deciding the top hundred positions in India Rankings. Based on the result of our study, we have proposed the Ideal and the Minimum Attainment Scores in each ranking parameter to achieve success in India Rankings. The findings will be useful for Institutions who are going to apply in future for India Rankings 2019.},

abstract={It is likely that only a small proportion of educators are willing, interested, and incentivized to complete an entire MOOC, but we believe that many more can benefit from our educational resources if we empower our participants to take our materials and put them to work. We launched the MITx MOOC Envisioning the Graduate of the Future under a Creative Commons (CC) license because we think that making the content explicitly open (with the requirement of attribution) would make it easier for the target audience (teachers, administrators, and others in the education sphere) to get value from the content. The decision to use a CC license, specifically CC BY 4.0, affected course development in several ways. The course team had to learn more about the intricacies of the various CC licenses. The work of finding, tracking, logging, and labeling resources (both third-party and created by the course team) involved a great deal of collaborative, detail-oriented work. Certain resources, like commercially produced music tracks, were no longer a good fit due to conflicts regarding terms of use. From the first run of the course, we now recognize the importance of collecting data regarding how much learners know about CC licenses and also about how they are sharing, using, and adapting our content. We now believe that releasing a course under a CC license does not guarantee that learners will notice and begin sharing and adapting our content. We hope to innovate in terms of data collection to make it easier for learners to report how they are experimenting with repurposing course content.},

abstract={More we know about our learners the better are we in a position to mentor them. This is more so in engineering education as this is a professional course focusing on skills also. Prior knowledge of the learner about engineering profession and motivation level of the learner are two important factors among several others that influence learner's perception of engineering as a profession. There are several approaches used by Engineering Education practitioners to know the prior knowledge of the learner about the engineering profession. This paper discusses about one such technique - Draw an Engineer at Work Test (DAEWT) technique used by the authors to understand the prior knowledge of the learner regarding Engineering profession. Freshman Engineering students are asked to draw the sketch of an Engineer at work. Required data regarding the background of the learner is also collected. These pictures drawn by are studied with respect to their family background and their previous education setting. To know the motivation of the students to opt for engineering program, students were asked to list jobs related to specific engineering disciplines as job after graduation is considered most important motivation. This awareness in the learner is analyzed with respect to prior education setting of parents to evaluate its impact on their motivation. This paper discusses the details of the methods employed and the analysis of the results.},

abstract={In this paper, we will be discussing about active learning techniques which will enhance students' abilities and makes them to overcome the fear of studies and lack of interest. In the present day, most of the students are discontinuing their studies due to many reasons like lack of interest, lack of proper prioritization of their interest, lack of good grade and many more. There might be many reasons for students for not getting engaged into academics but the main reason which makes them uninterested is lack of proper learning or teaching activity. So, active learning is just like a root of the tree which will make students to prioritize their interests in their learning age and make them to put their efforts to reach their goal. This paper also gives a clear idea about how to structure their mind sets and follow the path which helps them to reach their goal and also helps them to prioritize their interests and helps them to adopt according to current market needs.},

abstract={Knowledge, skill and attitude are three necessary ingredients for the success of fresh graduates both in terms of learning and employability. It is important to identify suitable teaching methodology to impart transferable skills to the participants. Outcome based curricula and experiential learning pedagogies create positive influence among participants towards learning. In this paper, Java web development course is considered describing course level outcomes connected with company's entry level program level outcomes. Case studies are used as assessment instruments towards measuring the abilities of the participants aligned with expected skills from entry level developers specific to Java Technology stream. Two approaches are discussed where the first approach uses normal class room delivery and the second approach just-in-time and scenario based approach. In the former one the software engineering and java concepts are covered as factual knowledge components where as in the second approach, an attempt is made to integrate process knowledge components from software engineering together with Java technology concepts using business scenario as a vehicle. The performance of the participants with respect to their case study deliverables is compared with two approaches. These results highlight importance of an integrated approach towards curriculum design and adopting appropriate teaching, assessment instruments towards imparting technical skills.},

abstract={Considering the Massive increase in the usage of Mobile phones and handheld devices such as Tablets, iPads, there is an exponential growth in usage of Mobile apps. Mobile applications are widely used for entertainment, education, for social networks and for increasing productivity. We propose use of mobile applications to teach and to create social awareness for sensitive topics. In developing countries, topics like HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, breast cancer, autism etc. are not taken seriously due to social awkwardness, cultural taboos, education system, social barriers and gender inequality. This paper we proposes a solution to this problem. As these applications can be used personally, there will not be any hesitation compared to discussion with a real person. Interactive application that is created will be explanatory enough for users to get appropriate and correct knowledge with its validation hence, reducing misconceptions. Development of such applications will lead to better awareness and better health for individuals. As a proof of concept, Android application is developed for awareness of HIV/AIDS. After use of mobile app it brings 53.2 percent increase in average marks of knowledge test about HIV/AIDS.},

Each program outcome is achieved through course outcome. The curriculum comprising of various courses is framed under the general guidance of the leading professional body. As course outcome is mapped to program outcome it was found to vary from strong to weak. The delivery methods for various courses attain the course outcomes. Hence, the program outcome is achieved by various teaching-learning methodologies. Out of which, chalk and talk is found as the most effective mode of instruction in undergraduate curriculum despite the availability of many alternate instructional strategies.

abstract={Since 2014 one focus of our research is looking into the effects of integrating Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in traditional education. We have developed in the past different methods of integration: as a full course recognition, partial course recognition, or project/activity based recognition of a MOOCs course completion, into a traditional higher education face-to-face course. The experience on integrating MOOCs in courses at Master level is presented and discussed in this paper. The analyse is based on questionnaires, reports and live discussions with students, during the whole academic semester. Studying online, open education and MOOCs still represent terms students are not familiar with, in Romania in particular. Still, we consider that the Open Life Long Learning Student need to acquire a new set of skills in an independent and self-determined manner as to identify, access, learn, analyse, apply and practice new knowledge using different media, information channels, and communication tools to enhance their skills and develop their careers. The authors proposed an asynchronous online course work to be integrated with the traditional in-class instruction. We looked into the students' interaction with MOOCs, the use of different tools, the educational value of learning online and the MOOCs impact. The conclusions present both strengths and deficiencies of integrating MOOCs based on this blended learning study case.},

The learning outcomes on a long run are reflected in Program Educational Objectives (PEOs), by the graduates of a program, spread in different knowledge spheres. This paper represents a case study implementation for PEO evaluation. An approach for evaluating PEO as an indirect means is being proposed in this case study. The method emphasizes on evaluation and attainment of PEOs. This is accomplished through alumni and employer surveys. These surveys are carried out more systematically by an online process to collect feedback from various stakeholders once in a year. The model proposed here is for obtaining the response for survey questionnaire at the institutional level through alumni association in coordination with placement cell, Industry Institution Interaction cell (IIIC). Further the survey includes inputs from professional bodies as well. Based on the quantitative and qualitative information obtained from the survey analysis and other groups, the PEO attainment is assessed with respect to different attributes. The attainment can be useful for continuous improvement in program.},

abstract={Over the last few decades, technology is increasingly becoming an important aspect of delivering education in formal and informal contexts. While it is true in broader sense, the technology integration has not been widespread and penetrating in developing countries. Moreover the use of traditional technology media such as audio systems and computers have been there for some time, the new media technology integration has been minuscule. The other dimension of technology use in education is the technology acceptance behaviour of users i.e. students and teachers. While it is easier to enumerate the benefits of technology use, it is more difficult to answer as to why users use or reject any technology. This paper utilises Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology to understand the students' acceptance of a Learning Management System in an engineering and Science institute of higher education.},

abstract={Capstone project (CP) is an important part of every engineering and computer science discipline at undergraduate level. The main purpose of these capstone projects is to encourage students to apply the knowledge acquired during their studies in previous semesters, in particular a capacity to personally manage and conduct a complex, open-ended project to show how proficient they are in solving real world or the research based problems. The Outcome Based Education (OBE) is an education system that emphasis on outcomes measurement rather than inputs of curriculum covered. Outcomes may include a range of knowledge, skills and attitudes. In order to obtain the desired outcomes, teaching components and activities should be well organized, planned and continuously improved. We adopted OBE in our curriculum and for the course on project work we have written course learning objectives (CLO), i.e. at the end of the course the student should be able satisfy these objectives and they are mapped with the program outcomes (PO). This paper presents a novel method for the outcome-based assessment of engineering capstone project carried by Final Year Students. The assessment is done based on the rubrics written for each phase of the process. The outcome of the each phase is assessed by evaluation team and the guide using the assessment matrix which is based on assessment rubrics. Assessment matrix covers all the attributes/parameters for the assessment of each phase. Mapping of CLO-PO is done based on these attributes. Percentage of attainment of each objective and outcome are calculated.},

In modeling and simulation lab for the second year undergraduate students, the open ended experiment is designed to expose the students to Internet of things (IOT) applications. Python language is one of the freeware and can be used to implement IOT applications using Raspberry Pi. In most of the industries python programming language is widely used for various test automation. Initially the python language is introduced to implement numerical computation algorithms, so that the students are familiar with the basic libraries. Then the open ended experiment is carried out using Raspberry Pi for IOT applications. In this experiment the students are sensing and retrieving data from the cloud. With this approach the students are exposed to python programming and IOT concepts which is most widely used in industry. It also helps the students to carry out higher semester projects in IOT based applications in a better way.},

abstract={Education apart from the basic needs of food, clothing and shelter, is another key factor to empower an individual. It acts as an enabler to elevate a person socially and from within. Education system has been evolving since human existence and various approaches are being used to teach. Focusing on professional courses, the quality of education is questioned and stands as a concern along with the unemployment issues. In India, there is a huge potential for technology growth. However, as per the National employability report, only 3.84% of engineers qualify for a startup technology role. Further, 2016 employability rate has been 17.91%, 3.67% and 40.57% for IT Services, IT Products and Business Process Outsourcing respectively. Apart from this, there are many forums in which the quality of education is being questioned, since education is linked with the job or business opportunity. One of the essentials in the professional courses is the curriculum design. It is very important to start with the curriculum that can enhance the knowledge of students and also make a prospective career. With these in mind, the improvement options have to be deeply thought and charted out. In this regard, a survey has been taken up with engineering professionals to get their feedback on how they view the education system. This paper focuses on the feedback from working engineering professionals, compares the existing and other curriculum options and provides a proposal for a value based curriculum design.},

Recent emerging trends show a move towards online degrees, essentially postgraduate, which involves the big MOOC providers and universities positioning themselves to capture a growing market of lifelong learners through a broader portfolio of diversified credentials. The core business of curricular education verified by a degree, however, is only just being touched by the MOOC revolution, with very few - though significant - experiences.

Reviews of such models are elucidated in detail of this context. An ideal education system should be modelled to unleash a student's potential & natural caliber. This can be achieved by a gradual transformation towards intuitive learning. Talent and knowledge gained by a graduate is never directly proportional to reputation of university from which the degree has been obtained. In today's world, the reputation of a college depends on the marks of its students and not necessarily on the quality of knowledge imparted by it. Competition is on a major upward growth and there is a dire need for the graduates to stand out and make their mark. Review about the system architecture and of the existing model of education reveals that we focus more on the performance of the students than the effectiveness of their performance. Necessity for technical knowledge about the specialization subject along with the domains which would be required in industry has been explained along with the various innovative models of educations.},

abstract={Outcome-based education (OBE) has become a necessity to make our engineering graduates employable and globally acceptable. OBE is an educational theory that bases each part of an educational system around goals (outcomes). It is expected that after graduation, each student should have achieved the basic purpose of education i.e. necessary skills to work in his/her area of specialization/interest. The assessment is crucial factor in the OBE, as the success of OBE lies in the continuous assessment of the goals and implementing the changes based on the feedback of assessment. This paper discusses the Course Outcomes and its importance in the assessment of Program Outcomes and Program Education Objectives. The authors have presented a case study of Course Outcome assessment and attainment method implemented in their own institute. The course outcome assessment method along with direct assessment and indirect assessment tools, with the detail mathematical calculations is explained with the example values. The results of Course Outcome attainment are used by the staff members for the attainment of POs, PEOs and for improving the overall teaching learning process.},

As a result of the ever-growing social media, it has turned into an essential scheme for viral marketing and influencing the masses. Hence, it becomes imperative to discern how information spreads on such networks and how much. The methodology suggested in the Restrained-Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (RnSIR) Model enables us to calibrate the spread of knowledge and material on networks. This paper proposes an interface which uses the calculations given by the RnSIR model. Essentially, this interface prompts users to give a network interaction data set as the input and outputs the information dispersion on inputted network. It uses the same algorithms to do this as the RnSIR model.},

abstract={Preserving the secrecy of confidential information transmitted over a network has always been of utmost importance. Increasing use of data communication over networks also increases the need of security. Steganography is a technique that screens the existence of information by masking it behind some other seemingly innocuous media. But if the presence of information behind media is revealed by any method, the main purpose of steganography is violated. This paper proposes and analyzes a technique for steganography named Compress-Encrypt-Stego that pre-processes the text before hiding it behind a cover image. In pre-processing, the text is first compressed and then modified using a key. Processed text is then concealed behind cover image using transform domain based steganography. DCT is used to transform the cover image to frequency domain. The technique is implemented for various cover images and for different values of plain text and keys using MATLAB. The proposed technique is analyzed by varying the number of bits used to hide the data. This paper also discusses the security analysis of the proposed technique.},

abstract={During the last decades, our society is witnessing an authentic revolution that, in a dizzying manner has deeply influenced, modified, and transformed the way of life of human beings. This constant and unstoppable revolution is transmuting all areas of our life: social, cultural, personal, labor, economic, training, etc. This new society is characterized by a high generation of knowledge and the constant and fluid processing of information. In this macro-context, the MOOC phenomenon emerged. MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) courses are based on the principles of massive, free access to all materials and resources offered online. This new didactic path can be constituted in an innovative techno-social tendency, especially oriented in the panorama of Higher Education to stimulate university improvement, open opportunities at the same time for education and training or, simply, derive towards a new business model for the universities. In addition to being an entry point for the popularization of science and knowledge, the future possibilities are enormous and are being studied in all their various dimensions. Many initiatives as a result have been developed to implement this new form of education. MOOC Courses and the Future of Higher Education presents the latest research theories and current examples of MOOC courses practices in Higher Education. The chapters represent an extensive assortment of interpretations and practices examples of MOOC courses, across areas as varied as teaching methodologies, instructional innovations, educational technology, etc. This work is structured in three sections, the first one covers the university institution in the knowledge society, the second analyzes the MOOC training proposals, and the third discusses the future role of MOOCs. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • The Virtualization of Teaching in Higher Education • Training and Professional Development at the e-University • Taxonomy of MOOCs • MOOC: Strengths and Weaknesses • MOOCs and the Scientific Community: Challenges and Innovation • MOOC Platforms • Directory of MOOC Resources • MOOC: Reflections of the Future},

abstract={MOOCs are arriving to the business sector. Especially within Human Resource Development and customer training. While some companies offer their own MOOCs, a few companies use external MOOCs to complement their HR offers. However, the awareness and perception level among HR managers in general is still lower as expected. On the other hand, many learners are taking MOOCs to upgrade their skills for the current job or to open up new career pathways. This indicates that employees and business learners are already making use of MOOCs on a global level, which leads us to the assumption that there is a significant bottom-up movement from professional lifelong learners in MOOCs. As there are no specific studies available for the European context, this article sets out to answer the research question if this bottom-up movement in the uptake of MOOCs by employees can be confirmed for Europe.},

abstract={The rapid and impressive development of MOOCs in less than half a decade has brought about contrasting arguments about the social dimension of MOOcs. This paper investigates how the socio-economic background of learners affects their own experience in the on-line course and their chances of course completion. We test whether learners from low SES have lower chances of completing the on-line course and whether participation in online discussion forums mediates the role of SES. Analyzing data from two MOOcs provided by Stanford University, we find that in both cases the hypothesis of a negative association between low SES background and course completion is supported. Moreover, we find that forum participation further reinforces the advantage of well-educated learners enrolled in one case, while does not have any significant effect for the other course. We conclude with some design implications for creators of on-line courses.},

abstract={During the last decades, our society is witnessing an authentic revolution that, in a dizzying manner has deeply influenced, modified, and transformed the way of life of human beings. This constant and unstoppable revolution is transmuting all areas of our life: social, cultural, personal, labor, economic, training, etc. This new society is characterized by a high generation of knowledge and the constant and fluid processing of information. In this macro-context, the MOOC phenomenon emerged. MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) courses are based on the principles of massive, free access to all materials and resources offered online. This new didactic path can be constituted in an innovative techno-social tendency, especially oriented in the panorama of Higher Education to stimulate university improvement, open opportunities at the same time for education and training or, simply, derive towards a new business model for the universities. In addition to being an entry point for the popularization of science and knowledge, the future possibilities are enormous and are being studied in all their various dimensions. Many initiatives as a result have been developed to implement this new form of education. MOOC Courses and the Future of Higher Education presents the latest research theories and current examples of MOOC courses practices in Higher Education. The chapters represent an extensive assortment of interpretations and practices examples of MOOC courses, across areas as varied as teaching methodologies, instructional innovations, educational technology, etc. This work is structured in three sections, the first one covers the university institution in the knowledge society, the second analyzes the MOOC training proposals, and the third discusses the future role of MOOCs. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • The Virtualization of Teaching in Higher Education • Training and Professional Development at the e-University • Taxonomy of MOOCs • MOOC: Strengths and Weaknesses • MOOCs and the Scientific Community: Challenges and Innovation • MOOC Platforms • Directory of MOOC Resources • MOOC: Reflections of the Future},

abstract={An enhanced Synthetic Aperture Radar algorithm (SAR) has been proposed for sea ice detection based upon region based segmentation using raster scan method. The MODIS data of RADARSAT1 and RADARSAT2 has been used as input data. This method consists of four stages. In first stage, input the radar image for processing. In second stage, apply Gabor filter to remove the noise from image. In third stage, apply region segmentation technique and scan the image using raster scan method. In last stage, calculate the parameters of ice like velocity, thickness and concentration to display the results. This paper is focused on noise removing process to enhance the accuracy of results using Synthetic Aperture Radar algorithm.

Industries are very much open to such an experiment and very cautious on deliverables by practice. They are encouraging project based learning and working very close to academia through their dedicated university programs. Internet being most widely embraced by the young generation, an attempt has been made to use the facilities like googles mail, blog, drives and youtube to the maximum for maintaining continues involvement and hence demonstrated the use of same in the education system. Being an autonomous institute is very good opportunity to adopt innovative teaching learning methods. Advanced Microcontroller and its application course being an elective at 3rd year of engineering education, offered for students having the knowledge of microcontrollers and programing language was more suitable for the project based learning. One such experiment is made in BMS College of Engineering(BMSCE), Bangalore. Methodology adopted and the results of the same have been covered in this paper.},

abstract={Quality is directly related with satisfaction of the learner and one can satisfy only if the learning environment provides full technical and infrastructure support and interactive user interface. Quality Analytics is the discovery and the systematic computational analysis of data statistics to find meaningful patterns especially valuable in areas rich with recorded information. Quality Analytics of learning environment evaluates the application based on various relevant quality parameters such as Business Qualities, Generic Qualities, System Qualities and Learner Response Qualities. These parameters should be focused upon to design analytical pattern to monitor the learner behavior. If any of the web-based application fails to deliver these then it clearly reflects the compromise in the quality of the product. ISO/IEC 19796-1 international standard focuses on quality management and assurance in e-Learning and it is also mandatory to scrutinize and assess the results generated by various quality factors in dynamic web based learning environment. This paper proposes analytics based method to generate and monitor values of some critical quality factors. Effective assessment of these factors is helpful in tuning the overall performance of dynamic web based learning environment and the analytics confirm the learner behavior towards the learning application.},

abstract={Computation is becoming an integral part of education, especially at college-level. Two MOOC courses provide an introduction to computation and are offered by MIT on EdX: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science Programming in Python has run 16 times and 6.00.2x Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science has run 11 times. These courses frame the world around computation, and show learners that they can think about problems they see in everyday life in the context of computation. Our paper shows an analysis of repeat learners (learners who enroll in the same course multiple times) and their behaviors over the many runs of these courses. Around 20% of learners in any given run of a course are repeat learners. Of these, the majority are two-time repeat learners (learners who took the same course exactly twice). We show that learners tend to perform better when they retake a course, and especially when they retake the course sooner rather than later. We also look at a subgroup of learners we call repeat cross-referencers (learner who accessed at least two previous runs of the course during the run time of a later run of the course). We found that repeat cross-referencers complete the course at a suspiciously high rate, and we speculate it is because they are looking back at answers from a previous course run. Lastly, we look at how learners perform in an introductory class and an advanced class. We found that many learners who take both courses are more likely to complete both courses and have more active days in the courses than those learners who only do one of the two classes.},

abstract={Creation of a technology enabled social learning ecosystem was started as an experiment in 2014 at the BMS College of Engineering, in partnership with WIKSATE. This platform available to the students for use anytime, anywhere, in any smart device, enabled them to connect and share with their peers 24×7, and learn as they interact even while on the move. The implementation of the platform was expanded gradually over the years to support all the departments and courses. This platform is now available to the entire college. With over 3500 students actively engaged in supplementing their formal education with social learning, the BMS College of Engineering is now the largest social learning ecosystem in India. The WIKSATE platform provides the students at the BMS College of Engineering, a powerful interaction engine to connect and share their learnings with their co-learners in a knowledge network. Further, this platform provides real-time data to faculty which give insight into student preferences and engagement and help plan continuous improvements in the course delivery and outcome. It also helps promoting a culture of openness and moderated learning providing a vital bridge to close the gap between educators and students. The results from the social learning analytics show that students have a natural motivation and inquisitiveness to get involved in interactions when empowered by a mobile centric ubiquitous access to knowledge networks. The results also show a steady growth of student interactions at all levels after their induction into the ecosystem.},

Our sample consisted of 131 students (male=66, female=65) studying in the 8th grade. All students had the same level of exposure to science courses at the school. A five-point Likert scale questionnaire was administered to understand students' interest, ease of use and attitude towards OLabs-based ABL. The investigation revealed that a sizable majority of the students, were excited about using OLabs based ABL methodology, in their current curriculum as well as in the future. The gender based analysis showed that female candidates were more interested in using ABL methodology. Our findings contribute to the design of a new pedagogy model for incorporating low-cost science activities with virtual labs to reach students in schools that do not have access to science labs.},

abstract={This work presents an overview of strategies to foster the participation of non-English speaking learners and instructors in the global online learning space. Taking into account the amount of people in the world whose first language is different from English, there is an increased need to extend the reach of online education initiatives into these traditionally excluded populations. Nowadays, the current state of multilingual support includes the usage of translated captions, subtitles and language specific platforms, each with its own advantages and drawbacks. A case studio based on data gathered from student feedback of Spanish-speaking learners of a popular MOOC is presented, where it is acknowledged the additional effort needed to study using material and holding forum interactions and discussions in English as a second language. Finally, further strategies are presented so instructors and online education providers could extend their reach and engagement.},

abstract={Evaluation is a process of assessing and measuring the educational system through many techniques like oral or viva-voce exam, subjective exam and objective exam etc. After conducting a survey on 200 peoples, we found, objective exam is preferred to evaluate the students frequently due to the easy and less time consuming in the evaluation of objective answer-sheet in compare to the subjective answer-sheet. This paper is a discussion on a solution to evaluate the objective answer-sheet automatically by computer. It is used to automate the import data which emanate from objective answer sheets into a computer. Its main advantage is the ability to work with every single scanner of the market, needing no extra drivers whatsoever and no special color printing of the forms. Optical character recognition technique is used here to recognize the response of the students. Thirty objective sheets were filled by 30 peoples to test the proposed system.},

abstract={Currently the traffic control system in place in our country is non-flexible and non-adaptive to the ever growing number of vehicles on the road. It does not take into account the changing density of traffic during the different hours of the day. Consequently the roads get congested frequently and intersections get blocked. Time and fuel, two highly important resources get wasted in this inefficient working of the present-day system. In this article, we propose a dynamic system that overcomes all these drawbacks. Our system uses cameras installed at the red lights and intersections to monitor the traffic dynamically. It then processes this information using image processing, computes the volume of the real time traffic, sets the timer of the signal accordingly. Simultaneously, it monitors if there is any scope of congestion at the intersection and adjusts the timer to prevent it. The entire system works autonomously and has a quick turnaround time, saving critical resources at every junction. The system also has the potential to adopt machine learning techniques in order to recognize the different emerging patterns of the future traffic and reach an optimal solution.},

The simple type of thin client only has minimum power consumption, less movable parts and fewer memories for storage. So, using the computers with the least power consumption becomes significant trend. The measurement of electricity usage of normal thin client is logically guessed and theoretically measured. The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is used to configure the thin client with the dependent server. The watts usage of the thin client and server are presented and it is very helpful for computer universities of developing countries. The least power consumption of the processors leads to the cleanest environment for future users. Moreover, the configuration cost for thin client is absolutely zero illustrated in the paper as it is based on obsolete PCs.

This constant and unstoppable revolution is transmuting all areas of our life: social, cultural, personal, labor, economic, training, etc. This new society is characterized by a high generation of knowledge and the constant and fluid processing of information. In this macro-context, the MOOC phenomenon emerged. MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) courses are based on the principles of massive, free access to all materials and resources offered online. This new didactic path can be constituted in an innovative techno-social tendency, especially oriented in the panorama of Higher Education to stimulate university improvement, open opportunities at the same time for education and training or, simply, derive towards a new business model for the universities. In addition to being an entry point for the popularization of science and knowledge, the future possibilities are enormous and are being studied in all their various dimensions. Many initiatives as a result have been developed to implement this new form of education. MOOC Courses and the Future of Higher Education presents the latest research theories and current examples of MOOC courses practices in Higher Education. The chapters represent an extensive assortment of interpretations and practices examples of MOOC courses, across areas as varied as teaching methodologies, instructional innovations, educational technology, etc. This work is structured in three sections, the first one covers the university institution in the knowledge society, the second analyzes the MOOC training proposals, and the third discusses the future role of MOOCs. Technical topics discussed in the book include: • The Virtualization of Teaching in Higher Education • Training and Professional Development at the e-University • Taxonomy of MOOCs • MOOC: Strengths and Weaknesses • MOOCs and the Scientific Community: Challenges and Innovation • MOOC Platforms • Directory of MOOC Resources • MOOC: Reflections of the Future},

There is also the Education Act of an India, 1987. Some of the guidelines are that: An institution of Higher Education may be sponsored or owned by the Government of the State or Local Government or by a Company incorporated in India or by an individual or association of individuals who are citizens of India, and who satisfy the criteria set out in the Schedule to the law for establishment of institutions. In 2003, the UGC of India passed a law permitting establishment of private universities. The private university act mandates the state body as well as UGC to regulate and undertake quality control of the content and curricula of academic programs. It is noticed that some newly approved private universities not following UGC Regulation 2009 which leads to failure of doctoral candidates who takes admission referring to allowed universities list from UGC website.},

abstract={Gesture recognition turns up to be important field in the recent years. Communication through gestures has been used since early ages not only by physically challenged persons hut nowadays for many other applications. Interacting with physical world using expressive body movements is much easier and effective than just speaking As most predominantly hand is used to perform gestures. Hand Gesture Recognition have been widely accepted for numerous applications such as human computer interactions, robotics, sign language recognition, etc Hand Gesture recognition techniques are basically divided into vision based and sensor based techniques. This paper focuses on vision based hand gesture recognition system by proposing a scheme using a database-driven hand gesture recognition based upon skin color model approach and thresholding approach along with an effective template matching using PCA. Initially, hand region is segmented by applying skin color model in YCbCr color space. In the next stage otsuthresholding is applied to separate foreground and background. Finally, template based matching technique is developed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for recognition. The system is tested with 4 gestures with 5 different poses per gesture from 4 subjects making 20 images per gesture and shows 91.25% average accuracy and 0.098251 seconds average recognition time and finally confusion matrix is drawn.},

abstract={The biggest driver for today's education is to match assessment to learning. School District (SD) leaders support efforts to hold schools accountable and are working to promote greater congruence between what's tested and what kids need to learn, if they are to thrive in the future. In order to promote important life skills like creativity, problem solving, and communications, one needs to have a hands-on life experience which is not only enjoyable but rewarding as well. Education is undoubtedly a tool for empowerment and IEEE K-12 STEM Literacy program in USA is fully committed to its implementation. Through various resources, like Tryengineering.org, Trynano.org and trycomputing.org, IEEE is trying to reach out to various school districts to tool teachers with hands-on lesson plans. IEEE is taking on the role of engaging the School Districts for further development of STEM programs more articulated & supportive of the specific/tailored needs. Working with and building a track record and demonstrating to potential partner School districts to have a history of returning dividends for their investments, increases the likelihood of IEEE being seen as serious and worthy partner.},

Learner interactions with Intelligent Tutoring Systems yield fine-grained data that are useful in generating meaningful information and illuminating understanding about learner behaviors and outcomes. We examine and analyze the log files generated by BioWorld, an Intelligent Tutoring System for the medical domain. More specifically, to further our understanding of the nature of reasoning employed by learners while solving virtual patient cases in BioWorld, one important step is to examine the initial list of selected diagnostic hypotheses before any other learner action is taken in diagnosing a case. By exploring the link between initial selected hypotheses and final submitted hypothesis, a better understanding of the learners' reasoning might be achieved.},

pages={100-104},
abstract={The paper emphasizes the need for teaching and learning mathematically intensive theory subjects using very powerful software tools. Under Electrical Engineering discipline, there are subjects like Signals & systems, Control Systems, Digital Signal/Image Processing etc. where teachers need to spend a considerable amount of time in classroom, teaching the mathematical concepts, ending up with very low level of learning by students. Learners find it very complex and unrelated as mere lecturing doesn't help them in effective interpretation of the information conveyed. There are many such software tools available nowadays having a powerful graphical data flow programming environment with a rich set of library functions and tools sets in simulation and real time mode. Such tools can simplify the teaching and learning of subjects with intense mathematical background in lesser time for the students from non-electronics stream. Here we present the efforts of teachers in learning and teaching, Signal acquisition, processing and analysis techniques for sixth semester students of Automation and Robotics in a much effective manner, using LabVIEW tool. The processed data can be presented from the tool using measurement graphs, indicators, animations, tabulated data, automated calculations, physical interpretation, visualization effects etc., thus enabling the learner with better understanding of concepts. Here we present the results of extensive use of tool to teach and learn different signal processing and analysis techniques used for biomedical signals along with the experience shared by teachers and students undergoing the activity. Course projects implemented by students after undergoing the proposed activity helped teachers to know the accelerated process of learning of the basic concepts of signal processing by students.},

In our workflow the autoevaluated programming exercises are created as if we were doing some test-driven development where the problem is our functionality and the unit tests are actually the verifications done to generate hints and evaluate the students. Once the problem is designed the unit tests create a code, based on the answer and the Anonymous userID, code that is obfuscated using an encryption technique. That code is used as the answer of a standard Open edX problem, creating a completely automated personalized environment and avoiding the use of Open Response Assessment tools that depend on the correction of other students.},

abstract={The concept of Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) brings the opportunity to adjust both the study content, and the context, based on the teaching needs. Therefore, in this paper, we present our best practices on enabling remote networking laboratories via Blackboard platform, including the Blackboard Collaborate Ultra extension, in order to efficiently react to the challenges of imminent campus closure imposed by COVID-19 breakout. We present an extensive survey as a feedback from students, which allowed us to measure and to quantify students’ experience and satisfaction with the remote teaching setup that successfully served 45 enrolled students. As the results bring the positive attitude towards practices presented in this paper, such teaching practices will foster some of the critical skills nowadays, such as collaboration, self-driven learning, and problem solving, and they can also serve as a successful example on how to efficiently cope with the limited access to traditional classroom resources within various courses.},

abstract={Assessing the quality of MOOCs is an important issue for learners since learners are paying fees for accessing the content (e.g. graded assignments), certificates of completion and for course credit. One of the unique advantages of online courses is that all the content can be assessed and analyzed even before the courses are released using various learning analytical and natural language processing tools. However, to date there are few studies in the literature published on the analysis of MOOC content. Furthermore, MOOC providers expect the course developers to periodically revise their MOOCs. Various types of analysis that can be done on the course text, video transcripts and assessments such as readability, listenability, videolytics, and text analysis. By analyzing the course content before its release, the content can be adjusted to target various learners. Subsequently, the same techniques can be used to analyze the discussion board posts and post-course survey to identify areas in a course that need to be modified in to order to improve the course quality for subsequent release. In this paper natural language processing and MOOC analytics were applied to several MOOCs to identify areas for revision to enhance their quality.},

abstract={The Covid-19 pandemic is changing our society on diverse dimensions (not only on an economic or social level). Before the 1970s, various businesses and economics could affect and improve technologies, and humans' life. Since we reached the 70ies, and with the beginning of the 3rd wave or the post-industrial era, the new modern technologies such as Information Technology (IT), Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Business (IoB), Internet of Energy (IoE), Internet of Manufacturing (IoM), Internet of Health (IoH), the emerging digitization, and innovative smartness in addition, issues such as know-how, do-how, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and others could influence businesses, the economy, urban infrastructures, societies, social impacts and even human life. Wars, sanctions, sciences, technologies, IT, IoT, and smartness work together and have impacts on each other's, businesses, economy, and human life. Fundamentally, during humans' history inventions and innovations have been created through restrictions and challenges. Wars, sanctions, low sustainability, risks of contagion, recessions, climate pollution, environmental change, biodiversity collapse, urban sprawl, growing urbanizations, lack of infrastructure, gentrification, economic instabilities, and recently health crises are introduced as main restrictions. Wars and welfare integrate with human's life desirably or undesirably and make innovation. Improvement through such innovative digital technologies are so admirable because most of them have changed the world. Sustainability has an important role for societies and urbans to improve their quality of livability and life. The world academic economy has changed from an academic SocioEdu economy to a data and innovative academic SocioEdu, ecosystem and economy, leading to the concept of the "Internet of Business-Education". with many popular IoT applications involved (i.e. wearables, smart city, smart society, smart healthcare, smart welfare, smart SMEs, smart retail, smart supply chain). This pandemic throws a spotlight on the interdependencies among business, nature, society, economy, and education. It may be tempting right now, when it is hard to see beyond the next few weeks, to dismiss the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a distraction. But they have been described as a "crowd-sourced purchase order from the future" precisely because they offer a tremendous business opportunity. Based on SDGs all developed and developing countries in a global partnership have to go with CSR strategies and Hybrid Businesses for improving social cohesion and welfare, health, education, inequality, blue-green environmental sustainability, and economic efficiency. In this article we will discuss how the 5th Wave/Tomorrow Age and i-Sustainability Plus theories could help us for a readiness to forecast, prevent and face to the SocioEdu Consequences of Covid-19.},

abstract={Developmental theories have established that adults are learning oriented only when they are convinced that there is a need to learn to effectively deal with real-life challenges. In such a scenario, it is affirmative that there has to be an ecosystem which is created to encourage learners to discover their own ‘needs to know’ and that learning interventions should be organized around real life application categories and sequenced according to the learners' readiness to learn. If learning could leverage employee know-how and further it, we would be able to customize learning to an individual's need. In the managerial space, we have opportunities where employees across levels and roles in the organization have access to the same content. In a scenario like this, learners ask the question-why should I refer to this source of knowledge? If learning could leverage employee know-how and further it, we would be able to customize learning to an individual's need. Even if we talk about only the managerial space, we have opportunities where employees across levels and roles in the organization have access to the same content. This paper is a case in point of the opportunity to customize and adapt content such that it leverages employee experiences to find meaningful and different value in the education path and process of every learner.},

In an endeavor to make the learning process more engaging through mobile platforms which perhaps attract the students and help them to gain knowledge with interest. Efforts have been done to make the process of online tests and information delivery to the students, yet there is a gap in knowledge transfer between teachers and students. Here we have proposed a platform that utilizes the combination of biometric scanners, speech to text conversion techniques and image processing techniques to make the process of learning effective, interesting, and collaborative. We have added a tool that uses today's modern mobile technology to take attendance and reduce the wastage of valuable time in the class. Also we developed a tool, called Smart notes that have ability to reduce the burden of taking notes on students and worry about the knowledge gap between sections of the same campus. To reach out to every student we have found that the Instant Chatting tool introduced will be helpful to clear all the doubts. This tool can be used to for group discussions and to perform group activities. Hence the platform introduced integrated with three tools provides an excellent quality of education to fulfill every students need in comparison to the existing methods.},

abstract={Many real time applications, they are generated continues flow of data streams have became more popular now a days. Therefore many researches attracted clustering data streams. Most of data stream clustering algorithms based on distance function which find out clusters with spiracle of shape clusters and unable to deal noisy data. Therefore density based clustering algorithms substitute remarkable solution to find out clusters with arbitrary shapes of cluster and also handling noisy data. In which the clustering is performing with the bases of high density area of objects and also segregate low density objects as noise. In this paper we studied a simple existing data stream clustering algorithm DenStream based on DBScan. Based on DenStream a novel data stream clustering approach “DDenStream” is proposed. DDenStream is a modified data stream clustering algorithm of DenStream. It is based on fading window model therefore it applies a density decaying technique when the evolving data streams are captured and improved the quality of clusters by extracts the boundary points when two or more than microclusters are overlapping each other by using DCQ-Means algorithms. This approach also resolved the overlapping problem of microclusters. It find out arbitrary specs and good quality of clusters with noise.},

The review highlights an innovative approach of requesting students of computer science to become active members of existing OS communities as part of their curriculum. The acquisition of a wide range of skills, increasing student motivation, support for contextual learning and student-centered courses as well as the availability of a wealth of data to inform and support decision-making by educators are the main advantages as identified by the SLR. Similarly, high barriers to entry in OS projects, difficulties related to student support, assessments, grouping of students and choice of an adequate OS project are the potential challenges. In this paper, the advantages and challenges of using OS in an existing framework of a course design and delivery have been discussed in detail. In particular, the potential impact of OS in computer science education curriculum has been explored from the perspective of education providers.},

abstract={In the current pandemic emergency, where everything changed in a matter of hours, many fields have confronted the situation with emergency responses, in many cases, with openness and collaborative approach. In the context of education, some view the current emergency as an opportunity for digital transformation and innovation in education. However, the emergency responses to have the desired impact in the long term, need to be strategically thought-through and planned. In this paper, we argue that open practices, sound design and virtual mobility based on administrative support principles can bring opportunities for quality education. Moreover, we reconceptualize and recontextualize the notions of blended, hybrid and flexible learning within this situation. The current paper is a conceptual contribution drawing on a case of a university experience, with a radical transformation focus, contextualized in current covidl9 educational emergency. To conclude, we propose a Hybrid Flexible Learning Framework based on two main pillars: virtual mobility and design that could be a useful conceptual tool for the current situation but also for future consideration, beyond the crisis.},

pages={68-72},
abstract={Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) generally have two modes of course delivery: the instructor-paced mode with multiple fixed deadlines to complete assessments or the self-paced mode with a final deadline when the course closes. Many MOOC platform providers have shifted from delivering courses in instructor-paced mode to self-paced mode, assuming that a longer, flexible schedule allows learners to better engage with and complete courses. Although this question of self-paced versus instructor-paced is not new, the answer is still relevant given that studies comparing the two course delivery modes of MOOCs provided mixed results and the pressure to run all MOOCs as self-paced. In this study, we took a deeper look into learner engagement differences between the two course delivery modes for one quantitative biology course and one computer programming course. Despite the differences in enrollment numbers and content, we found similar trends between both courses involving benefits to instructor-paced over self-paced delivery, especially when evaluating more engaged behaviors like posting to the discussion forum or submitting a problem answer. Interestingly, most completers finished the courses across 80-90% of the available days in an instructor-paced run. For self-paced runs, the median range of time a completer was active was less than one fifth of the time the course was open, but some completers did take advantage of finishing the course in a smaller or maximum window of time. We also found that most completers were active a similar total number of days in self-paced and instructor-paced course runs, despite having more days available in the self-paced runs and that the activity per day per completer was lower in self-paced delivery mode for both courses.},

This paper focuses on integrating classroom and laboratory with hands-on for programming course. This approach is student centric which brings in active learning. However it has been less researched area and adequate literature is not available on 'hands-on science' specifically for programming course. The work presented in this paper also extends from our previous work where debugging, code optimization and testing are emphasized. In the proposed approach each teaching session consisted of hands-on teaching and activities to support it. This requires strategic planning of the course and its delivery as discussed in the paper. Applying this approach, there is increase in the number of students scoring higher grades and overall improvement in the average. The paper also discusses the benefits and challenges of hands-on discovered in this case study that triggers further research.},

abstract={The University of South Africa (UNISA) is the largest committed open distance learning (ODL) institution in South Africa. In line with ODL principles, UNISA has rolled out electronic (e)-learning to all undergraduate modules as from 2013. An important challenge for the university has been the transition from the traditional paper-based mode of instruction to e-learning. This transition requires an e-readiness strategic plan prior to the e-learning rollout. E-learning readiness comprises an intricate, in-depth, continuous process of identifying critical issues that may impede the successful rollout of e-learning within the institution. There are a host of factors that need to be considered prior to embarking on an e-learning initiative which have not been considered prior to the e-learning rollout initiative of 2013. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for an e-learning readiness framework that can be used proactively for new e-learning initiatives and retrospectively to evaluate existing e-learning interventions to identify weaknesses in current e-learning practices. The objective of this paper is to improve interactive technology-enriched teaching with regard to e-learning practices.},

abstract={The status of education has always been the primary factor of a nation that defines its academic capital, human resource and vision of development. Sheathing this education sector with the recent advancements of technology would be one of the most concrete steps towards national development. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have evolved as a new paradigm of digitized open education which could be implemented in a massive domain of India. In a developing country like India where significantly large number of people live in rural areas and cannot afford quality education, MOOCs can definitely be considered as game-changer. The authors have worked over different aspects and strategy for implementing MOOCs over the vast domain of India. In this connection, different issues haunting implementation and their possible way outs have also been discussed briefly. On one hand with a more flexible and massive approach, MOOCs would be able to impart quality education over a huge domain of audience. On the other hand it would nurture the tremendously viable business opportunity in education sector. In this context, India is viewed as a potential leader and game-changing superpower of education in Asia pertaining to Vision 2020.},

abstract={Even today, there are institutions that, due to technical problems, lack of workers with the appropriate skills or because they do not have a sufficient budget, do not have an internet connection in the classroom where technology-related subjects are taught. Through this article we propose a new hybrid teaching method that combines the Open Massive Online Course (MOOC) and face-to-face work of the students. First, we present the problems identified along our experience. Secondly, we define both, the classroom resources and the educational resources we have used. In a next step, we describe in detail the architecture of the system and the communications that compose the proposed learning hybrid system. We have assessed that the proposed solution is valid, but we are planning to deploy pilot tests to indicate the features and limitations which can be addressed when teachers use this proposal. These pilot tests are framed within STEM and robotics education. The content to assess the solution in a future is also included in this paper.},

pages={84-88},
abstract={Graduate programs in engineering have theoretical courses like Software Engineering, Information Systems, Advanced Software Engineering, Software Architecture, Management and Entrepreneurship as part of the curriculum. These courses are challenging from both the students' and the instructors' points of view. From student feedback it has been seen that they view these subjects uninteresting due to a lack of practical component. The instructor's responsibility increases in making such theoretical subjects interesting for the students. These courses impart certain unique skills which the students need to apply in their professional careers. But the Lecture method which is still the most practiced and preferred one does not provide for active student involvement. To combat this problem a variety of teaching modes have been developed from different learning theories. Several of these techniques are in use in Post-graduate courses and corporate training courses where the number of participants is less. The author has tried some of these techniques like story-telling or case study approach, involved assignment and group correction, reverse knowledge transfer, i.e. teaching by students, etc. while teaching Information Systems for two sections of undergraduate students and has found reasonable success. This paper describes the techniques used by the author, the methodology, the implementation and the results thereof. Attempt has been made using quizzes/tests to draw conclusions about the viability and applicability of these innovative techniques in classes where the number of students is more than fifty.},

abstract={Recently, most of the engineering educational institutions are assessing their degree programmes for improving their curriculum design, teaching methodologies, assessment and evaluation process. There are clear guidelines prescribed by the Government accreditation bodies of each country for defining, assessing various graduate Programme Outcomes (POs). There are two ways to assess the POs such as direct and indirect assessment. Direct assessment of the programme outcomes includes various curricular components such as continuous assessment, final examination, assignments and projects etc. In general, indirect assessment of the programme outcomes includes various survey components. We have followed the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) body of India, for defining and assessing our Information Technology (IT) programme outcomes. This paper includes the efficient strategies that we have practiced in our programme for improving the POs of undergraduate IT programme. We have grouped POs into three major categories such as knowledge, skill and attitude. Along with NBA guidelines for assessing the graduate degree programme, we have considered few other assessment components such as co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. In this paper, we have discussed the IT programme outcomes of the past three batches of students and their improvements year-by-year. From the results, it is evident that the strategies improved the entire POs of IT programme at our institution.},

abstract={Today, more than ever, institutions of higher learning are recognizing the importance of integrating the use of information technology (ITs) to improve pedagogy and accountability needed for high quality education relevant for learners' productive contribution to the society and economic development. Despite increasingly widespread adoption and use of IT in education, institutions of higher learning in many developing countries are still in a foundational stage of maturity. Much as e-learning and its applications like Massive online open courses (MOOCs) have been proven to overcome critical education challenges for better teaching and learning developing countries institutions are lagging behind. Some challenges are systemic and some related to the technologies themselves like poor infrastructure and low bandwidth, others are due to lack of scalability to meet the increased cost, training, and rigor required to leverage the technology.

pages={104-111},
abstract={Stable task assignment among processors is a shrewd effort because such approaches require priori information about current processor load and then perform allocation. Initial policy structure includes no information about processor load but as the task groups arrive and get scheduled, this information acts as a prerequisite for next allocation. The task of load stability is tricky when static scheduling strategies are followed in allocation because these strategies require supplementary efforts to balance the load as the approaches designed so far do not follow load stability criteria during task allocation; rather they follow task adjustment to balance the load later on that enriches the overhead of context switching of tasks among processors. Context switching efforts not only includes the efforts for changing process address space, but position in ready queue is also affected. The work projected in this desertion performs load stability with priori information about processor utilization, based on this metric value processor space is partitioned among different categories. Depending on the load status, processors are categorized and an appropriate set out of those is identified that act as buddy for others and handles incoming queue. In other words stress free “buddy set” handles incoming job queue in place of their “stress underneath buddy set” processors so as to eliminate the pains of context switching and tasks adjustments after the tasks allocation.},

abstract={The pervasive presence of mobile devices and growing trends like ubiquitous learning make new demands on Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Users learn increasingly on the go and with multiple devices, instead of being tied to a fixed workstation. However, there is a lack of research how the usage of mobile devices influences the learning behavior and outcome in MOOCs. Thus, this paper presents a first quantitative study to examine this question. To enable a statistical analysis, a proof-of-concept implementation outline is presented, which enhances the Learning Analytics capabilities of the openHPI MOOC platform with contextual data to process various learning behavior metrics. Based on an analysis of four courses, it was found that users who additionally learnt with mobile applications showed a higher engagement with the learning material and completed the course more often. Nevertheless, the reasoning must be addressed with qualitative analyses in future, to better support their learning process and success on mobile and stationary devices.},

abstract={In the perspective of growing demand for research accountability, every university is making it an objective to achieve optimum performance in terms of research and development. Successful completion of research depends on the kind of supervision received by students from their supervisors. As students' satisfaction directly affects the quality of research at the university level, there is an urgent need of an explicit system that evaluates students' satisfaction with their supervisors. This paper aims to examine the experiences and challenges of post graduate research students with their supervisors. For this, data were collected through face-to-face interviews and a questionnaire aimed at recording response from 100 post graduate students of a private university in north India. From the study we identified relevant parameters like supervisor's expertise, active listening, availability and self seeking behavior etc. As these parameters are imprecise and difficult to measure directly, these can be expressed in fuzzy context. A fuzzy based approach is used to propose a system that measures the overall student's satisfaction.},

abstract={The new innovation in technology has enhanced online educating, for instance, virtual laboratories are progressively used to teach engineering laboratory activities. Technologies like virtual and augmented reality have reshaped the virtual learners experience. While a large portion of these endeavors' accentuation the significance of the innovation, few have tried to comprehend the procedures to capture, model and codify the laboratory tutor's knowledge. The absence of robust methods on how to automate laboratory tutor's knowledge to teaching and monitoring practical task on virtual platform has influenced the engineering distance learning outcomes. Subsequently, [1] suggest there is a need to investigate further on the best way to capture the laboratory tutor's knowledge, which is essential for teaching and assessing the practical skill of the engineering distance learners through current virtual and augmented reality technologies. In this study, we propose a Knowledge Based Educational (KBEd) framework that facilitates automating on-campus tutors' knowledge into augmented reality (AR) technology. Our study investigates the benefits of using artificial intelligent (AI) and augmented reality (AR) environment in teaching and assessing engineering practical skills. Further the study determined the usefulness of the proposed system by evaluating through first year engineering students with no prior experience of welding. The study results demonstrate that students who learned through proposed AI tutor in the AR environment effectively picked up the practical skills proportional to those in the genuine lab condition who learned with the real laboratory tutor.},

abstract={We propose a preferential theme matrix for selecting a problem in carrying out the minor project for 6th semester Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) students. The matrix comprises of emerging technologies, research areas and the application domains as the parameters. It included Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Mobility and Web Technology as emerging technologies. The focused research areas were on big data & analytics and image processing. The application domains were focused on social relevance such as environment monitoring, health care, safety and security, agriculture. And an additional open choice (others) was mentioned which gave an opportunity for students to explore other new technologies and research areas. Broadly the phases of conducting minor project are classified as team formation, problem identification/selection and project execution which in turn has several sub phases. In team formation students were given freedom to choose their partners with a team size of 4/5 within the same division. This phase was analyzed with respect to Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) grades of team members, which showed a good distribution of grades within the teams and across the entire teams. In problem identification the teams discussed about theme matrix with the assigned guides and presented the project synopsis to the evaluators. After these phases the project execution which in turn included requirement specifications, design, implementation, testing and deployment. To meet some of the pre-requisites for carrying out the projects, workshops on IoT, Cloud computing and open source design tools were organized. For promoting self learning in students, MOOC on the relevant technologies of their projects was introduced as part of minor project. The Continuous Internal Evaluation (CIE) of minor project focused on the processes of software engineering and Semester End Exam (SEE) was focused on product/prototype development, technical skills and external recognition. The entire process of conducting minor project met the expected goals with five prizes in SRISHTI state level project exhibition 2016 and five projects accepted for E-poster presentation in international conference.},

abstract={Self-study is realized as a tool for lifelong learning. In order to improve the professional skills of budding engineer, self-study is a component of teaching learning process which helps teacher to monitors the materialization of student activity. The skills that can largely be developed by self-study are communication, critical thinking and practicing modern tools. Activities assigned to the students are (1) Assigning literature to read and apply in their laboratory experimental understanding, (2) read, comprehend and understand the advances in the corresponding field, (3) to demonstrate the concepts taught in class by an experiment (4) get trained and use modern tools for problem solving. The attainments of specific outcomes defined by NBA are designed in such way that it brings desirable change in the student way of learning. Self-study aids the process by measuring various technical and non-technical learning outcomes of student learning. It provides opportunities for students to learn or refine their knowledge of technical concepts traditionally taught in a classroom as well as concepts that are difficult to teach in a classroom setting. Further, it reveals the combination of both teacher-centered and student-centered teaching methods which involves student's activity, gaining and sharing knowledge among the peers. This paper discusses the design, development, implementation of self-study module in the core course of heat transfer in one of the engineering curriculum of BMSCE. It encompasses in-detail discussion on framing of course outcomes, evaluation of different self-study component with rubrics, mapping of CO to PO, improved program outcomes attainment obtained for two consecutive student batches compared with traditional course. The method utilizes data obtained from student marks in internal tests as a means of continuous internal evaluation. This paper discuss the mode of evaluation of selfstudy component, and reasons for the enhanced attainment of CO, PO and hence PSO. The practice of self-study will pave a framework for encompassing cognitive and psychomotor learning outcomes of engineering curriculum.},

pages={90-97},
abstract={The popularization of online chatrooms facilitates students to discuss, question and answer based on their learning content. The chat text reflects students' learning concerns, learning progress, learning enthusiasm and so on, which has important reference and analysis value. But the previous studies on students' chat text were mainly to explore the participation behavior and interaction patterns, while less attention was paid to the dynamic process of students' learning. Meanwhile, the existing technology lacked effective analysis methods for the highly variable and multi-topic commingled chat text. Therefore, this paper proposes the Multi-topic Analysis by Extraction and Combination (MtAEC) architecture. On one hand, MtAEC locks the questioner and respondent in the chat, tracks and collects their text, and calculates the text similarity to verify whether the lock result is correct. This method confirms the role of the questioner and the respondent in the chat. On the other hand, to solve the problem of topic analysis in the multi-topic commingled chat text, MtAEC points the parent pointer to the interrogative sentence, and traverses down the child pointer to search the answer. In addition, this paper analyzes the topic of the students' chat and visualizes the experimental results in the form of charts based on the group chat text of a real course. Then, we summarize the students' learning concerns, learning progress and learning enthusiasm, which are helpful for teachers to better understand the dynamic changes of the students' learning process.},

But with the rapid development of online education, few people put emphasis on the quality of online education. More people concentrate on the spreading and expansion. There is still much to study and talk about. The paper builds a distributed data warehouse and analyzes the course data from Coursera. It measures the real quality and effects of online education in country distribution, homework completion, grading policy and peer assessments. The paper introduces a new grading policy for peer assessment and talks about the current problems and the future development of MOOCs.},

abstract={In recent years an engineer or technocrat graduated from any country is expected to provide his/her services to any location of the globe for the betterment of mankind. In this respect it has become necessary that an engineering graduate possesses a set of skills which encompass technical knowledge, practical skills and right attitude. Every educational program defines its program educational objectives (PEOs) and program outcomes (POs)/course outcomes (COs) which spell out the capabilities that a graduated and graduating engineer should have respectively. In this regard, an Outcome Based Learning (OBL) has become an accepted philosophy in technical educational institutes. This paper discusses the basics of OBL and presents a case study carried out for one of the courses of ETC program for the attainment of desired POs through spelled out COs. The study clearly indicates that a focused teaching-learning process and an appropriate assessment has led to attainment of expected POs to a level of more than 70%.},

abstract={Phishing, the act of impersonating the legitimate websites is one of the most frequently growing Internet crimes. The purpose of the phishing is to acquire the sensitive information of the users and to use that information for illegal financial gain. In this paper we design and implement an intelligent approach for phishing detection. Our approach utilizes ten features of the webpage and proposes a fitness function for categorizing the webpage. Genetic algorithm is utilized for assigning weights to features. We have collected a dataset of 494 phishing and 450 legitimate URL's. By using this technique 87% of the sites are correctly classified.},

abstract={Mobile applications for MOOCs (Massive Open On-line Courses) offer the possibility to download learning material to enable network independent learning sessions. The management of downloaded content on mobile devices is a manual process for the learner, which has the potential for automation. This includes the deletion of learning material that is likely to be no longer consumed. In this paper, a metric was defined to quantify learners’ references to previous videos based on the order in which the videos were viewed. In an observational study involving three MOOCs in the field of computer science and IT systems engineering, learners referred to previous video content only a single time on average. Outliers made use of earlier content up to 44 times during a course. Referenced videos belonged in most cases to the current or previous course section. The learners referred more often to previous videos during the course period compared to when participating in self-paced mode, while learners who earned a record of achievement referred to previous videos significantly more frequently than those who did not.},

abstract={The pedagogy of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) can be easily developed by using robotics and computational thinking tools. Also, inclusion and integration of diverse groups of students can be promoted using these tools. Today we can find many tools for teaching robotics. This kind of tools allow us to promote innovation and motivation of students. In this way, students will be able to work during the learning process in an innovative and motivating way. Since it is increasingly common to find robots in our daily lives, it is important to integrate robots into education as well. There are already cooking robots, autonomous cars, vacuum cleaner robots in houses and gardens, or prostheses. This paper describes a course focused on a combination of teaching methodologies, educational robotics tools, and a student learning management methodology, all within an inclusive framework to strengthen the presence of women and other under-represented groups in engineering.},

abstract={Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) can be a platform for campus students to publish co-created educational material. Involving students in the creation of a MOOC has the potential to lead to a more learner-centered MOOC while also providing students with the opportunity to gain skills. This exploratory case study evaluates that potential. We analyze the learning gains of the students, the MOOC they created (the product), and our own support during the development process. Analysis shows that the MOOC had a similar quality to our other MOOCs. Videos and assignments were more creative than usual, but were not created with a much more learner-centered focus. The students gained valuable skills while making the MOOC, such as leadership skills and video presenting skills. The support from university staff was seen as very valuable, but could have been expanded to truly elevate the quality of the content. We end this paper with some practical recommendations for other teams wishing to help students create a MOOC.},

abstract={Although the massive and open nature of MOOCs necessitates more technology support for instructors, existing prediction research has been barely capable of offering real-world solutions. One critical case where MOOC instructors could benefit from real-time technological support is the design of collaborative activities, in particular group formation. In this regard, this research work investigated the use of in-situ learning technique to produce useful and actionable information that could assist instructors in group formation while the course continues. Focusing on a particular MOOC context, a predictive model was created to compute the probability that students would participate in group discussions or not. Using these probability scores, actual group behavior was also predicted for three cases: at least 2, 3 or 4 different students would post in group discussions. According to the results, the model was able to accurately predict individual student behavior as well as group behavior before the actual collaborative activity had taken place, suggesting its potential for real-time use. Future research involves the exploration of other approaches for creating actionable predictions and the application of the predictions in practice in an ongoing MOOC.},

abstract={Fundamental skills acquired by undergraduate students during their academic, play a crucial role in their career. One such skill is computational thinking (CT), which will help to solve problems algorithmically using computers. Computational thinking will improve their problem solving skills in a non-conventional manner as this leads the student to think in multiple paths to reach the solution. However, it is a challenge in Computing Education to develop student's ability to solve problems in an algorithmic way. The aim of this paper is to introduce a potential and pragmatic approach to develop computational thinking skills in novices.},

abstract={In this paper BPNN performance for the gait analysis with using the different modulation techniques i.e LDA and MDA. Gait Analysis is the new technique in the biometric identification, the gait have more advantages over the field of biometric systems like face recognition, finger printing etc. Gait Analysis is a method by which individual can be recognized by the manner of walk. Less unobtrusive gait recognition system over the other biometric traits is the main advantage. i.e. it offers the identification of an individual at a particular distance, without any physical interference or contact with an individual and can be easily apply on the low resolution image frames as well. In this paper, firstly the video of an individual in captured, secondly background subtraction is applied on that so as to remove the unwanted information, thirdly feature extraction is carried out to extract the various parameters by using the Hanavan's model, and finally the recognition is performed by using BPNN+LDA and BPNN+MDA techniques, are used for the training and the testing purposes, and the matching can also be performed on the basis of CBIR. All the processes are performed on the gait database and the input video.},
