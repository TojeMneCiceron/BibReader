abstract={There has been a dramatic expansion in both the amount of available large-scale educational databases and educational mining techniques. Educational data mining has been a fertile subject of research in recent times; further, the use of educational data mining has become popular among both researchers and practitioners. Log files generated by computer-based learning environments like Intelligent Tutoring Systems contain a wealth of information about learner behaviors that characterize academic success. There is growing interest in mining these data sources for knowledge-based discovery to reveal relevant, meaningful, and useful educational information to illuminate our understanding of learners' behaviors and outcomes. All too often however, extracting the pertinent information from the data to leverage the data mining techniques can be a major roadblock; for example, the asynchronous nature of the data logged in computer-based learning environments and data mining tools pose several challenges for mining data. We sought to mitigate this by developing a parser for the BioWorld System. In this paper, we explore the viability of a hand-coded parser by presenting BioWorldParser (a suite of scripts), which was developed to parse and retrieve data from raw log files generated by the BioWorld system, to help leverage educational data mining techniques in the context of an Intelligent Tutoring System for the medical domain.},

abstract={Self-directed learning is a potential methodology recommended in medical education to promote life-long learning. To promote self-directed learning skills and to make students life-long learners, self-directed learning sessions were conducted at Melaka Manipal Medical College (Manipal Campus), Manipal University, India. Students' knowledge in the topics was assessed in three formative assessments conducted during the course. This study was conducted to explore whether there is any change in students' readiness for self-directed learning as they experience the curriculum, and also to find out whether the change is reflected in students' academic performance in topics learnt through self-directed learning. To assess the change in self-directed learning readiness, self-directed learning readiness scale was administered to the students at the commencement and at the end of first year of the MBBS course. Students' scores in all three formative assessments were also collected. There was a statistically significant increase in self-directed learning readiness of students at the end of year compared to the commencement. Students' scores significantly increased in second and third when compared to first formative assessment. A weak positive correlation between the assessment scores was observed. The study demonstrated that students' readiness for self-directed learning was increased as they experienced the curriculum which was reflected in their academic performance.},

abstract={To teach and demonstrate the Power System Stability aspects to the undergraduate students, a laboratory model has been developed. Computer based simulation software's are used to teach different aspects of power system by most of the Institutions. These simulation studies often do not demonstrate the physical sense of power system behavior to students. Moreover, making the students to visualize the effect of instability is a very big challenge faced by the teaching community. This paper describes the experimental set up built in the Electrical Engineering Department of Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore, consisting of an alternator connected to infinite bus through parallel transmission lines. In this experimental setup, the generator is brought to instability by changing the operating conditions. Further, the oscillation is controlled and brought back to stability by controlling the excitation and line reactance. This gives the clear idea about stability and its enhancement to the students.},

abstract={Comprehensive curriculum is essential for overalldevelopment of professionals. Like other countries, in Indiatoo the engineering educators have a task of insistingattainment of graduate attributes to suit the global needs. Teaching engineering courses help us to attain the programoutcomes [1]. However, real challenge lies in efficientattainment of ethical principles and effective functioning ofprofessionals as a member in diverse team by effectivecommunication. Thus proper guiding and assessing practical engineering skills is the need of the hour. We focus on educative growth of ethical and communicative skills attained in the present study wherecapstone project is taken as an example. The project issubdivided into two level first the pre-project and the finalproject. Capstone project is an amalgamation of all the basiclearning and the application component of the curriculum. In order to evaluate the attainment of ethical skill andcommunicative skill, the assessment rubrics need to bedesigned well. This work discusses the manner which canmeasure the attribute attainment quite precisely. After acquiring fundamental knowledge on engineering subjects, the students are made to work on acapstone project. Attainment of the program outcome (PO)is quantified with a class with seventy students. The finalyear under-graduate students are divided into group of fourto the maximum. A topic and a faculty adviser ofcorresponding specialization is assigned to each of thegroups. Rubrics of formative assessment are attentivelychosen to incorporate the attributes of ethics and soft skills. Bimonthly evaluations were graded by the guide anddepartmental faculty other than the guide. The summativeassessment is done along with an external examiner from the neighboring institution. Mode of attainment of courseoutcome (CO) to PO has been discussed in the full paperalong with the state diagram of the evaluation process. Asthe students go ahead with execution of the project throughregular meetings with guide, the communication is assessedby rubrics which emphasize the report writing skilldevelopment. The written communication skill is thensubsequently corroborated by oral presentation. Thepresentation is evaluated again to judge the oralcommunication skill as a part of a team of maximum fourmembers with varied aptitudes. Another important point isin the rubrics we have introduced plagiarism check to ensure the ethical attribute of the graduate. By keeping a threshold value for acceptance limit of plagiarism one can evaluate the skill of written communication and originality of thoughts. The attainment of CO to PO is graded from theformative assessment score in pre-project work and finalproject work. In order to take in-depth evaluation, we havetaken 75% of the total marks as the criteria for assessing aparticular skill of a student. Capstone project is consideredas culmination of all the teaching-learning in the curriculumfor the discipline. After framing the rubics and mapping ofthe particular Course Outcome to Program Outcome, logichas been exercised selectively to map with either strong ormoderate attainment of the latter. The process and it's prosand cons will be discussed in detials in full paper.},

abstract={In India, a large percentage of graduating engineers are not industry ready. The primary reason is that the colleges have outdated syllabi leading to a wide gap between the curriculum and the requirements of industry. Students who take up internships are very few among Tier-2 and Tier-3 colleges. All these problems result in graduates who are unemployable without training in basic skills by the industry. An internship could help the students in overcoming many of these shortcomings as they learn about corporate industries and receive basic training. This paper presents a novel initiative towards this end by the IEEE Student Branch, College of Engineering, Chengannur. It aims at spreading awareness about the advantages of taking up internship opportunities, providing the basic training and helping students get internships. The program was a huge success and helped a large number of students in securing internship offers. This model, if replicated in other colleges could significantly improve the employability of students and help them improve their academic performance and engineering skill sets.},

abstract={Higher education or lack of higher education effects many socioeconomic characteristics such as employment, income and social mobility. Increasing access and removing barriers to higher education is a key factor in allowing people from different socioeconomic backgrounds, to make significant change in their own lives.The psychometric test - the screening and entry test used by higher education institute in Israel (the equivalent of the US SATs) is one of the barriers standing between young people in Israel and higher education.Many factors contribute to the ability of an individual to pass this test, some of have nothing to do with ability or motivation. Factors regarding an individual's socioeconomic background affect the outcome of the test, and therefore the access to higher education.While 72% of all individuals how finished high school, belonging to the highest socioeconomic group in Israel, take the test, only 21% of the lowest socioeconomic group do so. The average gap between individuals from the highest and the lowest socioeconomic background is an unimaginable gap of 200 points (out of a possible score of 800 points). This figure means the difference between higher education and no higher education, and everything that stems from it.An industry of about 80,000,000$ (more than 250,000,000 ILS) a year has grown over the years, around preparation courses for the test, with an average coast of 2,500$ (8,000 ILS) per course, giving an unfair advantage to whomever can afford it - the already privileged groups of society.The Ministry of Social Equality in Israel has launched a free massive open online course designed to help university applicants prepare for the psychometric test. With a foreseen Return on Investment of over 605,000,000 ILS in the next 15 years, the course is designed to remove or at least lower one of the barriers to higher education, and promote equal opportunity.This article will elaborate on the reasons behind the decision to create a free open digital course by the government, designed to help learners prepare for the psychometric test. It will touch on the outcomes of the first course runs, and the ways in which the Ministry of Social Equality plans to reach relevant publics and mitigate the course to those publics with little to no experience with digital learning, language barriers, low digital literacy, and low self-efficacy.},

abstract={With the development of latest technologies and their usage become wide spread in all areas of the world. Moreover, using large amounts of data and also their applications are sophisticated and thus the technologies lead to consume huge amounts of energy, latency, bandwidth and also throughput. In the case of client server communication, the client is completely depending on their server at computation logic; meanwhile, the application logic is only performed at the client. When the age of thin clients becomes popular in developing countries with the profits of security, reliability, less vulnerability, maintainability and sustainability have been moved to the usefulness of their inevitable good behaviors. Interactive applications can be caused some bottlenecks of performance delay over thin client server network. The safest technique to access the smooth performance is the explanation and reintroduction of overclocking method which can be used efficiently for the system under some special considerations which was not warranted by manufacturer's rating. As overclocking is not a new method, many researchers have been used it in a variety of application fields and mixed with other resource demand machine learning methods. This paper figures out that thin clients are used with Remote Desktop Protocols connection and the rendering of interactive applications (only used Benchmark apps) on them successfully accomplished by overclocking method.},

abstract={Various learning models have been proposed till date. Many dimensions have been included in different learning models proposed by different researchers. This paper summarizes a number of dimensions important for consideration in learning models. An improved multistage learning model has been proposed which include a large number of factors proved successful earlier. Factors for successful learning have been included from cognitive science perspectives also. Use of this learning model is surely going to prove better for overall success in the learning process.},

abstract={Scripting language employ high-level constructs to interpret and execute one command at a time. In general scripting languages are easier to learn and faster to code than structured and compiled languages such as C and C++. Scripting languages have many important advantages over traditional programming languages. In future the usage of these languages is likely to increase. In this paper we discuss and report our experience in teaching scripting languages lab at the undergraduate level, 4th semester. Scripting language is an umbrella term used for languages like unix shell, TCL, perl, java, python and LISP. Out of these, we have chosen UNIX shell programming and python for our curriculum. The authors report various pedagogical activities like multiple assignments, peer assessment within a group, self learning through e-resources and course project that were employed during the course. The course projects were specially designed so as to make students explore the vast number of python packages. The authors found that these activities definitely enhance the learning experience and there was a remarkable change in the learning level of the students as compared to previous years as evident in the grades obtained by the students.},

Teaching such subjects in a meaningful way is always a challenging task as the students feel that writing code in assembly and Embedded C is difficult. The programmable controllers and processors are taught to Electrical cluster students which usually include Electronics and Communication Engineering, Telecommunication Engineering, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering and Electrical and Electronics Engineering. The traditional method of teaching these subjects was faculty centric where the teacher teaches the theoretical concepts using blackboard or power point presentation. To enable the students to learn the practical applications, there is a need for a new approach of teaching the subject where in the student's performance is evaluated based on various factors such as communication skills, analytical skills, professional ethics etc. In this direction, the paper focuses on the methods based on Outcome Based Education (OBE), adopted by the author to make the students understand the subject better.},

In this paper, we explore all facets of SWAYAM, from its inception to its day-to-day functioning to how the platform is meeting its goal of increasing access to quality education across India. We linger on SWAYAM's most distinctive feature: its credit system, that allows higher education institutions to integrate MOOCs into their offering. We also present some of the early achievements of the platform: In December 2018, the first SWAYAM examination was conducted, with about 16% of India's public higher education institutions allowing their students to earn academic credit through MOOCs taken on SWAYAM [2, 3]. In the second SWAYAM examination, conducted in May 2019, that number grew to 21% [2, 4].},

The translator in a translation not only constructs sense at the stimulus of the source text, but also makes meaning for the readers in the target language, using the target text as a stimulus. Thus the process of translation is divided into two steps: the construct of sense and the make of meaning.},

abstract={In these days of intuitive and intelligent software systems the audience is not going to put any effort into using the product, application or operating system – they'll expect it to be obvious. The perception of any software is driven entirely by its User Interface (UI). Usable software sells better and unusable software is abandoned. Designing usable UIs is challenging and instilling such designing skills in students is even more challenging. This paper investigates Experiential Learning methodology used to imbibe UI Designing Skills in students through the course "Principles of User Interface Design". The primary objective was to attain Graduate Attributes/Program Outcomes (POs) 1, 2 and 3 as defined in the Outcome Based Education (OBE). The approach comprised of two main activities – Identifying Good UIs and Bad UIs and Designing UI Prototypes. A rubric based assessment was used to test the concepts' realization among students. This novel approach did not claim to have given students deeper knowledge in UI designing. Nevertheless, it did aim for a useful foundation. The approach can be adopted in designing good UIs in mini projects and capstone projects.},

The results obtained for the first study indicates that there exists moderately strong relationship. The second study shows that correlation coefficients of related courses are better while that of some unrelated courses have moderate value. This means that in case of related courses the skills acquired in a prerequisite course can help them to do better in the current course. This exploratory analysis when properly interpreted can help plan and retrospect and re-adjust the mode of assessment or course delivery to enhance student learning.},

abstract={Dedicated servers are deployed by companies to meet the ever growing computing demand. More storage and more security are sought after by companies. The inefficient scaling of hardware, higher deployment time, installation of old operating systems on new hardware are just some of the areas where dedicated servers suffer. Cloud severs can be used in lieu of dedicated servers. This will not only decrease the overall IT budget of companies but will be more flexible. This paper is a survey done on three start-up companies to inquire about the dedicated servers. Amazon Web Services have been used to rent a cloud server which hosts a website. Comparisons are done graphically and some observations drawn by the companies' executives about cloud and dedicated servers are mentioned in the latter stage of the paper.},

abstract={One of the original purposes of MOOCs is to democratize education worldwide in order to advance towards a fairer society and universal human development. However, initial findings suggest that there are a number of challenges that MOOCs face to achieve their maximum potential in developing countries and regions with complex issues of access to high quality education. The majority of research studies on MOOCs focus on one or a small number of courses, or an overview of an entire platform or system, such as edX or FutureLearn. However, these kinds of investigations can mask important regional variation in different parts of the world. In this study we conduct a longitudinal analysis using data from six years of courses from MITx and HarvardX, focusing on the particular Arab world sub-population, and comparing to the rest of the world and also on their human development index. A close investigation of this subpopulation will help us better understand what kinds of course registration and course-taking patterns are influenced by regional cultural factors, and what dimensions of MOOC learning are more universal. In this work we present initial results after conducting exploratory analysis on 452 MOOCs (~4.5M unique learners) from MITx and HarvardX, which show that despite the important cultural and geographical contrasts, the general trends are quite similar. Still, we observe some significant differences, such as lower completion metrics for Arabic countries when performing this comparison within each human development category and also some differences in percentage of enrolments per course category.},

The challenge for us as course facilitator is to utilize the existing potential that information technology offers to prepare our students for this information revolution. In this regard, we have proposed an integrated learning framework by considering two courses, web technologies laboratory (WT) and advance database management systems (ADBMS) of sixth semester in information science department at undergraduate level to make students apply knowledge effectively in building real time applications. The key focus of integrated learning was attainment of focused outcomes b, c, g and k (ABET criteria).We are elated that we attained outcome i as a bonus, although it was not focused. In this paper, we show that integrated learning framework led to attainment of focused outcomes, improved skills in students such as presentation skills, teamwork skills, and problem solving skills. This also led to performance improvement in examination and increased student's confidence level. This makes students to stand out in crowd and acquire an edge in competition.},

abstract={Outcome-Based Education (OBE) is a student-centered learning method that focuses on empirically measuring student performance. OBE has become the standard of practice in the engineering education programme. The measurement of student performance is done using both direct and indirect assessment tools. The value obtained out of these tools are then transformed to a score and checked whether they meet the required attainment level of Course Outcome set for a particular Course. The scores of all the Course Outcomes collectively contribute towards the attainment of Programme Outcome. This process is recursively applied for four years until the student completes the Programme. This paper presents a direct assessment method used in measuring the Programme Outcomes (POs) via appropriate direct assessment tools. A sample assessment presented in this paper shows a process of attainment of graduate attributes stated by NBA which are in line with the Programme Outcomes of Washington Accord.},

Anecdotal observations on individual student trajectories reveal distinct behaviors which may correlate with prior experience level. We build models to correlate these trajectories with student characteristics and behaviors of interest, specifically prior experience level and video engagement.

The science of psychology can answer all these questions. But surprisingly, we are never taught psychology as a mandatory science. The World Health Organization has defined health as "a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity". Today's curriculum gives more stress on physical well-being and, contrastingly, very less stress on mental well-being. The question arises “should psychology not be taught in elementary school curriculum?” Of course it should be!},

Introducing a programming language to students with no background is often felt to be challenging in terms of syntax and control flow of a language. The paper discusses an open source graphical programming tool built on Minibloq platform that allows students to focus more on creative part of programming. The paper proposes a graphical approach to programming where a student need not remember any constructs of a programming language, but relies on the approach to solve a problem. The programming utility is developed for an open source Arduino platform. Currently the tool is developed to control a real robot built around Arduino platform. Thus a platform to learn fundamentals of programming as well as robotics is made available to students. The graphical programming tool with the robotic hardware was found to be easy to learn by high school students during an outreach program conducted by the authors. The framework is also extendable beyond programming and can be further developed to understand robotics.},

abstract={Computer systems play an integral role in all facets of the engineering profession. Systems users are always in need of faster, more powerful, yet cheaper computer systems. This calls for an understanding of the processor-level components of computer systems, their design and operation, and their impact on the overall performance of the systems. To fulfill this requirement the course on Computer System Design and Architecture has been introduced in the 3rd semester. Earlier, there were two courses offered with titles “Computer Organization” in Semester 3 and “Advanced Computer Architecture” in Semester 8. These two courses were not related and there existed a gap of 4 semesters in learning of these two courses. Students were unable to appreciate the architecture related concepts in other courses of lower semesters. As mentioned in IEEE SWEEBOK curriculum recommendations, a wide semantic gap exists between the computer's intended behavior and the workings of the underlying electronic devices that actually do the work within the computer. This gap is bridged through Computer Organization. On the other hand Computer Architecture is the course that specifies the relations and parts of a computer system and it deals with mainly three elements viz. Instruction Set Architecture, Computer Organization and Hardware. Accordingly, a course on Computer System Design and Architecture which combines the study of Computer Organization and Computer Architecture is designed to be offered at semester 3. The next challenge came in the form of delivery of the course. Since a detailed conceptual understanding of computer organization and architecture is required, which was not possible only with classroom delivery, self study activity was introduced which provided ability to the students to compare various processor architectures, their functionality and visibility to information processing. This continuous process helped them acquire knowledge, values, skills and understanding that they will require throughout their lifetime.},

One of the biggest limitations/ challenges in MOOC today is conducting effective assessments in a large-scale environment. The quality of large-scale assessment is under threat from multiple sources including assessment instrument specific and measurement errors. Assessment instrument specific errors are related to the extent to which assessments meet its objectives while measurement errors are incurred during the process of evaluation. A survey of sample of existing assessment instruments used for large scale assessments is conducted to identify assessment instrument specific errors. In this paper, we have proposed the usage of technology to build electronic item banks for avoiding assessment instrument specific and measurement errors, thereby improving the quality of assessments. We have proposed 12 unique item types which are amenable for automatic evaluation. The process of evaluating students response automatically is discussed in detail for each item type. These automated item types provides cost effective ways for achieving validity and reliability for large scale assessments.},

This descriptive paper maps the microcredentials that currently exist, using data gathered from the MOOC platforms (e.g. Coursera, edX, Udacity, FutureLearn, and others). Data include price, length of program, availability of academic credit, and level of effort per week on over 450 unique microcredentials. This paper uses a two-step cluster analysis to group miocrocredentials across type, using factors including price, duration, and weekly effort. Grouping microcredentials across MOOC platforms is a first step to understanding what place these credentials might occupy in the overall landscape of higher education.},

abstract={The Indian higher education system in the post-independent times continued the colonial practice and so got isolated itself in the world higher education ranking system and not having indigenous ranking system meant we are practically working in the closed compartments. Except for a few research and management institutions, by and large the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) did not appear in the global rankings, this non- appearance is a reflection of a policy neglect on higher education system in the country, leading to only a few institutions finding their places in the world rankings conducted by different bodies. The policy response to address this problem was that India having National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) to rank HEIs. The two year old NIRF has to be made robust enough for it to become relevance in improving the quality of education system. To this end research paper systematically engages in content and discourse analysis of NIRFs methodology, to identify its gaps and make a policy recommendation for developing it into a robust framework.},

abstract={Outcome based education (OBE) has been adapted in major education institutions particularly in engineering education. This has been used extensively since the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) has made it mandatory for program accreditation. The OBE focusses on outcomes of the program rather than curriculum framed for the courses. Outcomes may refer to the knowledge or Skill gained, competency and employability of the graduates of the program. In order to achieve this outcome, the syllabus has to be carefully and meticulously planned with scope for continuous improvement. In the Department of Electronics and Communication, BMS College of Engineering, Bangalore, We have adopted the OBE system. This paper aims to provide the evaluation process in our department to measure the outcomes. For each course, the course outcomes (COs) are methodically articulated keeping the focus on Program outcomes (POs) that are defined by the NBA.},

abstract={It is well established that learners have different learning preferences. There are multiple ways of characterising learners based on their learning preferences available in the literature. Even though there are efforts to design pedagogic practices considering the learning preferences of learners, it still demands further investigation. Further, what factors influence learning preferences of learners is also an interesting dimension of research. This paper discusses about our observations over changing learning preferences of learners over a period of time and investigating the influence of factors like gender, urban / rural divide and medium of instruction on learning style preferences of learners. This study is desirable as it will help design content as well pedagogy respecting the learning preferences. Learning style preferences of students of undergraduate engineering degree programs are used for the purpose of this study. Though there are different learning style assessment methods / tools available in the literature, because of availability of software tool and the familiarity of authors with the tool, Questionnaire from Index of Learning styles (ILS) by Richard M. Felder and Silverman is used in the study. It is evident from the results that learners' preferences are changing from verbal to visual, reflective to active, sequential to global and sensory to intitutive. The results of the study are presented in the paper and discussed.},

The focus of the work is to suggest a method, where in, the student shall apply the tool to understand concepts of few courses of the on-going semester, or courses of previous semesters. This is achieved through an initial attempt to understand the usage of the tool, apply it to comprehend concepts in suitable courses, and finally use the tool to apply, formulate, design, implement and demonstrate a self-designed task, also known as the ‘Open-ended’ experiment. The proposed method of introducing the modern tool can be included in any semester, and when implemented in most semesters, leads to an overall development of the graduate with necessary attributes, as the proposed method includes an attempt to relate various courses in the program. The work concludes with details of results presented in the III semester.},

abstract={Graph theory has been demonstrated by many researchers to be useful during the conceptual phase of mechanism design. In this regard it has been put to use by many works for systematically synthesizing varieties of epicyclic gear trains (EGTs) of one degree of freedom. This paper makes use of the solutions derived using graph theory and introduces a procedure for identifying the constituent links corresponding to the chosen EGT graph concept so that it can be realized into a 3-D CAD model. It is seen that certain EGT graphs do not lead to meaningful 3-D representation. Conditions for a graph to result in a meaningful EGT structure are also derived in the process.},

abstract={Emerging load demand cannot be fulfilled by the output of one generator. Therefore two or more generators should be synchronized in order to share the load. The synchronizing variables of voltage magnitudes, frequency of the voltages, phase angle difference between the voltages and the phase sequence of the voltages should be considered. Synchronizers are widely employed in the industry. University students learn the theories of synchronization. Most of the laboratories in universities do not have practical modules or laboratory equipment to demonstrate the synchronization process. Traditional synchronization systems are not suitable for the visualization of generator synchronization. “A Practical Module for Generator Synchronization System” is designed to overcome the problem of understanding synchronization process. This system is useful for the students in understanding the synchronization process along with the real time simulation of the synchronization. The system will demonstrate the synchronization process of two generator outputs either manually or automatically. It will also synchronize two generators. The system consists of voltmeters to give the voltage of generator output, frequency meters to give the frequencies of voltages, bulb system to indicate phase sequence, a synchroscope and a phase meter to indicate the pulse width variation of two voltage outputs. The system is prepared for the laboratory equipment and tested under the laboratory conditions. This paper presents how the separate sections of A Practical Module for Generator Synchronization System were developed and its results.},

However, there is a strong feeling in the industry circles that students graduating from engineering colleges are not industry ready and many of them are not employable. Academia has also felt a strong need in terms of producing the necessary quality talent. It has been quite some time since industry and academia started working together to enhance the employability of engineering graduates and make them industry ready. Various models have been initiated by big industry captains to make this collaboration workable. But the big question is how effective these models are in terms of their applicability and usefulness to all the stakeholders in industry and academia. Through this paper, we discuss some of the offerings under the industry academia collaboration model. An analysis of various challenges being encountered during the evaluation of effectiveness of such models is also discussed. A few potential cost effective ways to address the underlying challenges are put forth towards the end of the paper.},

In order to attain the program outcome the curriculum for the program is designed in a manner that the students get trained in all the 12 Program outcomes. The courses are taught to the students by various teaching methodologies like class room teaching, laboratory experiments, seminar and projects. Each course is designed with specific CO's and each CO is mapped to the PO. The attainment of CO's is quantified by assessing students. Their performance is tabulated and analysed using MS Excel software. The quantification methodology involves detailed question paper articulation wherein each question is mapped to a CO and its corresponding PO. Thus considering continuous internal evaluation data one can measure the attainment of CO and the PO for a batch of students. The level of attainment also can be easily varied based on the level of the course and efficiency of the student.},

abstract={The technological rebellion has made current generations to depend more on the digital world in their day to day life. The effectiveness of the digital world has changed the learner's perceptive towards the education system. The impulsivegrowth of technology has increased the popularity of Information and Communication Technology which has created a research scope in Computer network domain thus Computer network course in the curriculum of Computer Science and Engineering plays an important role. It is always a challenge to teach Computer Networks course to students as the course requires a practical exposure more than the chalk and talk. It is very hard for students to envision the concepts of computer networks, protocols formats and understanding packets flow during teaching in classroom. To overcome above said challenge, pedagogical practice such as active learning through simulation tool is identified in delivery of the course. This paper discusses the effective use of a Packet Tracer (PT) simulation tool in the teaching of computer network concepts. A structured learning approach is introduced by using packet tracer tool in teaching network concepts and series of exercises are designed and developed to give the visualization of each layer functionality. These practical exercises helped in active learning to use the packet tracer to simulate campus network. This pedagogy practice encouraged the students' to build the clarity on the physical devices like router, access points, switch and their configurations. The troubleshooting skills were practiced by introducing the errors deliberately and how to resolve is learnt through the tool. Computer network simulation activity include the concepts of NAT, Subnetting, V-LAN setting, services of TCP/UDP, packet format details, application layer protocol like DNS, DHCP, E-Mail, FTP and HTTP. Activity is evaluated through demos, presentation and quizzes. Rubrics based assessment is followed to ensure uniformity and transparencyin the evaluation. The average marks obtained in quiz by students before using PT tool is 65% and after using tool is 85%, it shows significant improvement of 20% in learning the fundamental concepts of computer network course.},

abstract={This paper presents innovative approach for teaching the subject Process instrumentation at the undergraduate level in Instrumentation engineering as a part of an effective teaching learning process. The approach presented attempts to elicit interest of the students on a continuing basis by illustratively bringing out the application perspective of theoretical concepts through a series of learning aids. These learning aids involve industry field visits to identify the process parameters of interest for monitoring and control in different application domains, formulate measurement techniques, identify primary sensors, transducers and their deployment, there by facilitating an opportunity for the students to not only connect the theoretical concepts to the real world application but also to develop an exploratory learning attitude, need analysis, communication skills thus helping them to evolve as a pro-active engineering professional. The details of the said approach are carried out at fourth semester level as an experimental basis; the metrics used for assessing the learning outcomes are presented.},

abstract={Proper structuring of course scheme in curriculum contributes to better learning. The courses mapped to the fundamental graduate attributes may be placed at the early level of the curriculum. However, courses which mapped well with designing and applying attributes are posing a challenge as far as the attainment of Program Objectives is concerned. An exercise is made to measure the impact of bringing changes in the integrated curriculum in chemical engineering scheme and compared with the chemical engineering scheme of other institutes. It is observed that appearance of a fundamental course in the Curricula alter the attainment of Student Learning Outcomes (SLO).},

abstract={Implementation of Outcomes Based Education (OBE) has become essential to ensure the quality of Graduates from a program. The accreditation norms emphasize the need to: (i) develop the ability to apply knowledge of sciences and engineering to solve, design, develop, implement, test, analyze systems/sub-systems related to the engineering domain, (ii) develop the ability to perform in diverse teams through effective communication, and (iii) demonstrate professional behavior through concern for society, environment, safety and health. One the important attributes required to be developed is communication skills. In this work, we commence with the importance of communication skills, and suggest methods of including this competency in the curriculum. We conclude with some examples implemented in the program. The suggested methods can be included in any of the courses and when successfully implemented in most courses, leads to significant improvement in the ability to communicate by the graduating engineer.},

abstract={Recent technologies provide wide opportunities for learning at remote places and enables people collaboration anywhere. In this paper, we present the future advancement in the teaching learning process in India. As mobile phones and tablets are getting more keenly intellective and more widely used than in the precedent decades, they have become a familiar tool in our present environment. Utilizing them as a cognition tool calls for accommodations that are compatible with the concept of communication tools. Various studies suggest that ‘Digital education’ is comparatively more effective than traditional learning. The proposed system uses an inter network for teacher — student interaction and sharing of resources and messages. It allows knowledge-building and learning process to be run in collaborative learning environment. In this system, a student can create, collect and share inculcate data immediately anywhere, anytime. This enables them to play active role in knowledge building process. Hence, we have proposed a combination of m-learning and e-learning based application along with the concept of BYOD (bring your own device) which is advantageous to both the faculties and students of educational institutions for smart learning.},

abstract={In this study, we introduce a model that captures and visualizes the dynamical process of individual intention forming and the translation of this intention into actual behavior when learning in MOOCs. To validate the model and further our understanding of learning in MOOCs, we constructed a short survey based on this theoretically grounded intention-behavior dynamics model. This survey was sent to MOOC learners who at the time of their respective MOOCs indicated that we could contact them for further research purposes. The combination of open and closed questions referred to the most recent MOOC they took and was answered by 84 learners. The results revealed that most learners start a MOOC with a specific intention in mind, but that nearly one third of these learners reformulates this initial intention, once or more often, at some point due to barriers they encounter which hinder or prevent them from reaching their individual intentions. These barriers are mainly non-MOOC related, which may be valuable input for future research as well as guide the development of interventions for supporting learners to reach their personal learning intentions.},
